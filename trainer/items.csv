    <h2 style=""font-size:21px"">Healthcare Partners Partial Takeover Offer Fails</h2>
    <h3>8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER</h3>
  </header>

  <p>Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.</p>

<p>On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. </p>

<p>As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  </p>

<p>Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. </p>

<p>Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.</p>

<p>ENDS

    <h3>8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER</h3>
  </header>

  <p>Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.</p>

<p>On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. </p>

<p>As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  </p>

<p>Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. </p>

<p>Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.</p>

    <h3>8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER</h3>
  </header>

  <p>Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.</p>

<p>On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. </p>

<p>As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  </p>

<p>Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. </p>

<p>Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.</p>

    <h2 style=""font-size:21px"">Healthcare Partners Partial Takeover Offer Fails</h2>
    <h3>8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER</h3>
  </header>

  <p>Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.</p>

<p>On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. </p>

<p>As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  </p>

<p>Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. </p>

<p>Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.</p>

<p>ENDS

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Healthcare Partners Partial Takeover Offer Fails
    8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER
  

  Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.

On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. 

As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  

Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. 

Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.

ENDS

    Market Update and Director Resignation

  TRS:   Market Update and Director Resignation

Following completion of the HuaHan International Holdings (Hong Kong) Co Ltd (“HuaHan”) transactions in 2016; TRS Investments Limited (“TRS”) wishes to update the market on developments with its forward business intentions.

TRS has, in consultation with HuaHan investigated potential property transactions in New Zealand since their investment in TRS. The investigated transactions have not however been pursued. The nature of these intended transactions was consistent with the nature of transactions disclosed in the shareholder documentation circulated at the time of HuaHan’s investment in TRS.

HuaHan has now advised that it no longer wishes to pursue these types of transactions in New Zealand with TRS. HuaHan’s nominee to the TRS Board, Hao Sun, has accordingly resigned with immediate effect.

However with assistance from HuaHan, TRS has been introduced to a Chinese company with an established business and are interested in reverse listing that business into TRS. The directors need to undertake further due diligence but believe the opportunity appears very good. TRS is looking to finalise and agree a term sheet for the transaction and will then be in a position to update the market more fully.

In light of the change of direction and HuaHan’s intentions, TRS has not received funds from a requested drawdown from the HuaHan Working Capital Facility (as was approved by shareholders last year). TRS relies on this facility for working capital and accordingly this has placed cashflow pressure on TRS. TRS will continue working with HuaHan in this respect but notes that any new transaction will likely involve upfront payments which would improve TRS’ cash position.

  Market Release | 28 March 2017

Dividend Reinvestment Plan strike price and FX rate for 2017 interim dividend

Auckland Airport advises that the strike price for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan operating in respect to the dividend payable on 4 April 2017 has been set at NZ$6.6935 per share. The strike price is inclusive of a 2.5% discount.
This strike price will apply in calculating the number of shares to be issued to participants who have elected to receive additional shares rather than cash.  The strike price has been determined in accordance with the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and is calculated as 97.5% of the volume weighted average sale price of Auckland Airport shares sold on the NZX Main Board over a period of five business days starting on 20 March 2017.
The company also advises that the foreign exchange rate used for the payment of the dividend on 4 April 2017 to Australian investors in AUD has been set at 0.9239.

    Loan Asset Sale - Update
    2:51pm,  5 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  5 April 2017 

 
 
On 5 March 2013 Allied Farmers Limited (Allied Farmers, NZX: ALF) advised that it had entered into an agreement to sell various loan assets with nil book value to a confidential third party (“Loan Asset Sale”). At that time ALF advised that the consideration for the Loan Asset Sale resulted in an immediate net payment to ALF of $100,000 and possibly up to a further $500,000 dependent on outcomes unknown at that time. 
 
ALF advises that the Loan Asset Sale was the assignment by its wholly owned subsidiary, Allied Farmers Investments Limited, of loan assets to SPF No.10 Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of litigation funder LPF Group Limited.  SPF No.10 Limited is providing litigation funding to Robert Walker, the liquidator of Property Ventures Limited (in Liquidation) (the “Company”) and various of its subsidiaries, in relation to litigation against the Company’s directors and its auditors, for breach of duties owed to the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
If the Company’s litigation is successful, ALF is entitled under the terms of the Deed of Assignment to a proportion of any net proceeds of that litigation (that proportion being confidential).
 
The Liquidator has advised that the case is progressing well and has provided updated guidance on the possible return from that litigation for ALF, based on the current circumstances advised to the Liquidator by its legal team. Highlighting the difficulties of predicting the outcome or the final quantum and the inherently risky nature of litigation, the Liquidator has advised that, if successful, the final quantum will be higher than that predicted in 2013, and accordingly that ALF may be entitled to a substantially greater amount than $500,000. 

ALF does not expect that any return would be received in the current financial year.

Garry Bluett
Chairman

    AIA - Wholesale floating rate note issue
    3:51pm,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Market Release 6 April 2017

Wholesale floating rate note issue

Auckland Airport has today completed an issue of $150 million of floating rate notes to institutional investors which will be used to partially refinance its maturing $150 million floating rate note on 11 April 2017.

Phil Neutze, Auckland Airport’s chief financial officer, says “Together with the 10.5 year Australian Medium Term Note issue in March 2017 and the November 2016 seven year domestic bond issue, this three year floating rate note supports Auckland Airport’s well-diversified portfolio, which is spread across a range of New Zealand and offshore markets and tenors.”

The floating rate notes have a term of three years and a margin of 75 basis points over BKBM. The offer was made to New Zealand and offshore institutions with ANZ and CBA acting as joint lead managers on the issue.

  16 March 2017
Air New Zealand adopts ASX Foreign Exempt Listing

Air New Zealand today confirmed that it has changed its ASX admission category from ASX Listing to an ASX Foreign Exempt Listing, effective from 17 March 2017.

This means that Air New Zealand will be expected to comply primarily with the Listing Rules of the NZX Main Board (being the rules of its home exchange) and is exempt from complying with most of ASX’s Listing Rules.

Waivers to NZX Listing Rules that are currently relied upon by Air New Zealand are summarised in Appendix 1.

Air New Zealand continues to have a full listing on the NZX Main Board and Air New Zealand shares will continue to be listed on ASX.

Air New Zealand remains committed to best practice in corporate governance, including guidelines of the NZX, ASX and the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority.

Ends.

• Operating statistics table

February market conditions
Air New Zealand carried 1,268,000 passengers during the month of February, an increase of 2.4% compared to the same period last year. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) were 2.0% higher on a capacity (ASKs) increase of 5.3%. Group load factors were down 2.6 percentage points overall to 81.6%.

Short Haul passenger numbers increased 2.2%.  In the Domestic market demand (RPKs) increased by 5.9%, with capacity (ASKs) increasing by 6.4%, due to increased services on Auckland – Queenstown and the main trunk routes, as well as growth on the regional routes resulting from up-gauging to larger aircraft.  Domestic load factor decreased 0.5 percentage points to 83.2%. 

Tasman/Pacific demand (RPKs) decreased 2.2% while capacity (ASKs) increased by 4.1%, due to the up-gauging to larger aircraft on several Pacific Island routes. Load factor on Tasman/Pacific decreased 4.9 percentage points to 78.1%, as the Tasman routes continue to be impacted by additional market capacity compared to the prior year. 

Long Haul passenger numbers increased 3.1% when compared to February last year, with demand (RPKs) up 2.9% and capacity (ASKs) up 5.5%. Load factor on Long Haul routes was 82.8%, down 2.1 percentage points. 

On Americas/UK routes, demand (RPKs) decreased by 0.8%, with capacity (ASKs) decreasing 1.2% due to reduced frequency on the Auckland-Los Angeles route, partially offset by increased services to Houston and Buenos Aires. Load factor increased 0.3 percentage points to 83.3%. 

On Asia/Japan/Singapore routes, demand (RPKs) increased 9.1%, with capacity (ASKs) increasing by 17.2%, reflecting additional frequency on the Shanghai route over the Chinese New Year holiday and the new seasonal service between Auckland and Osaka. Load factor, although still strong at 82.0%, decreased 6.1 percentage points. 

For the financial year to date, Short Haul passenger revenue per ASK (RASK)* decreased 6.6% and Long Haul RASK* decreased 14.6%.  Removing the impact of foreign exchange, Group-wide RASK* decreased 9.0%, and Group-wide yields for the financial year to date decreased 7.3% on the same period last year.  

*  Air New Zealand’s operating statistics will provide Passenger revenue per ASK, or RASK, going forward as a key metric of revenue performance. RASK is defined as passenger revenue for the period divided by the total ASKs for the period; compared to yield which represents the passenger revenue per passenger kilometre flown.

Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific extend alliance

Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific have extended their strategic alliance partnership on services between New Zealand and Hong Kong for a further five years until 2022.

The alliance has delivered a range of benefits to travellers since it was first put in place in January 2013, including greater choice with more frequencies, enhanced connectivity to each carrier’s networks and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits. The extension of the alliance agreement is subject to continuing regulatory approvals.

Cathay Pacific currently operates seasonal double daily services between Auckland and Hong Kong while Air New Zealand operates a daily service on the route. From December 2017, a new seasonal service between Hong Kong and Christchurch will also be introduced under the alliance, operated by Cathay Pacific.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the non-stop service will operate three times per week from 1 December 2017 – 28 February 2018, departing Hong Kong on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays using Airbus A350 aircraft, providing a welcome boost for tourism to Canterbury and the South Island.

Australian and New Zealand airlines to form new aviation industry group

On March 9, Australia and New Zealand’s major airlines announced the establishment of a new industry group to advocate and pursue reform on public policy issues that impact the aviation sector and broader economy in the region.

Airlines for Australia and New Zealand (A4ANZ) will enable Air New Zealand, the Qantas Group, Regional Express Holdings and the Virgin Australia Group to contribute to the policy debate on issues that affect all Australian and New Zealand travellers, including those relating to airports, taxation and fees, access to efficient infrastructure and broader regulatory reform.

Professor Graeme Samuel AC, the former Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission whose professional career has spanned senior roles in law, investment banking and public service, will be appointed the independent chair of A4ANZ.

A4ANZ will be governed by a Board made up of a representative from each member airline, in addition to the independent Chair, to oversee the management of the industry group. The CEO will be appointed in coming months.

The group will be funded by its members: Air New Zealand, the Qantas Group, Regional Express Holdings and the Virgin Australia Group. Member airlines are Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Qantas, Regional Express (Rex), Tigerair Australia and Virgin Australia.

    Argosy Agrees 9-Year Lease at 82 Wyndham Street
    11:20am,  4 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Argosy has today announced that it has successfully reached an agreement to lease approximately 2,657 square metres of space across two floors at 82 Wyndham Street in central Auckland to Panuku Development Auckland, an Auckland Council organisation.

The lease is for a term of 9 years, with a break clause (with penalty) at 6 years, and will commence in August 2017.

The top floor of the building is leased to long term tenant Boffa Miskell on a recently renewed lease leaving one 1,575 square metre floor available.  The remaining floor is being marketed for lease, with good enquiry, and will be available for occupation in the second half of FY18.

Argosy is completing an extensive $9 million refurbishment of the entire building. The upgrade is being completed to a high standard including a minimum 4 Green Star¹ built rating and is targeting a 4 Star NABERSNZ² energy efficiency rating.  

Following the upgrade, the building will provide very efficient, cost effective space and an attractive working environment for tenants.  New services will include facilities to encourage cycling to work, an increase in the building’s fresh air supply, a smart lighting system linked to automatic blinds, a window film that improves solar conversion, a variable refrigerant flow air conditioning system and the latest water saving and metering systems to enable usage to be measured for NABERSNZ. 

¹Green Star rating tools have been developed by the NZGBC (New Zealand Green Building Council) as a way of predicting the energy use and environmental impact of a building from the design phase to completion. 
²The NABERSNZ rating system is based solely on the actual energy use of existing buildings.

    Arvida On Track to Deliver Strong FY17 Result
    9:28am, 23 Nov 2016 | HALFYR
  

  - Underlying Profit1 of $9.6 million, up 31% on pcp.
- Underlying earnings per share of 3.46 cents, up 18% on pcp.
- Care occupancy tracks higher to 95%.
- Momentum in unit sales with strong resale gains.
- Outlook – the business is performing well and is on track to deliver strong FY17 result.

Financial Performance

Arvida Group Limited (NZX:ARV) today announced a Net Profit After Tax of $19.4 million for the six months to 30 September 2016. The results include a full period of operations from the Aria villages and a three-month contribution from Lansdowne Park.

For the first six months to 30 September 2016 demand continued to strengthen for Arvida village and care facilities. Total revenue for the period increased to $46.9 million. Care facilities revenue represented over 72% of total revenue. The care facilities’ occupancy rate continued a positive trend and ended the period at over 95% across the Group.

Total operating expenses were $37.2 million and Bill McDonald CEO said “we continue to invest in our people and systems with the view that enduring synergies will be delivered from associated efficiency and productivity improvements.”

The investment properties delivered $14.3 million of gains in fair value from a desktop valuation review completed by CBRE at 30th September 2016.

Underlying Profit of $9.6 million compares to $7.3 million for the prior corresponding six month period. Included within Underlying Profit were $3.9 million of gains, comprising $3.2 million from 87 resales of existing units and $0.7 million from sales of 12 new units. Good momentum was evident in unit sales, with new unit pricing delivering strong resale gains across village stock and contributing to the fair value increase.

Underlying profit per share2 increased 18% on the prior corresponding period to 3.46 cents per share.

Balance Sheet

Total assets grew to $537.2 million, up $76.5 million since the start of the financial year.

External bank debt was $32.4 million at 30 September 2016. A new $80.0 million term bank facility was put in place in October. The facility provides sufficient headroom to fund planned brownfield development and acquisition activity. Arvida remains conservatively geared at 10% on completion of the October acquisitions and capital raising.

Acquisitions and Capital Raising

On 1 July 2016, the acquisition of Lansdowne Park was settled. This village added 93 units and 50 aged care beds. The purchase was funded by $14.6 million of bank debt and $6.0 million of shares issued to vendors. Bare land adjacent to the village has since been acquired with a view to constructing up to 5 villas.

On 20 September 2016, the purchase of Bethlehem Views and Copper Crest Village Estate in Tauranga and Lauriston Park in Cambridge was announced. The villages added, in aggregate, 247 units and 88 care beds plus significant capacity for future brownfield development. The $66.4 million purchase price was satisfied by the issue of $18.5 million shares to vendors, a pro rata renounceable rights offer that successfully raised $41.8 million, with a 90% take-up of entitlements amongst shareholders, and the balance from the new banking facility. Settlement occurred on 3 October 2016 for all three villages.

Commenting on the recent acquisitions, Bill McDonald said “the villages are in prime growth regions where we didn’t have a presence. Market reaction to the acquisitions has been positive with the rights offer receiving strong support from institutions and existing shareholders.”

Integration of Lansdowne Park was successfully accomplished in the period and progress with the integration of the three recent acquisitions is proceeding smoothly.

Further Acquisition

On 23 November 2016, Arvida entered into a conditional agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, to acquire 100% of the shares in Cascades Retirement Resort Limited for $21.2 million. Cascades is located in Hamilton and comprises a recently constructed aged care facility and integrated retirement village. It has 37 retirement units and 74 care beds as well as bare land for future development of over 40 units. The acquisition is immediately accretive to earnings and is to be funded from existing debt facilities with gearing increasing to 14% post completion. Settlement is expected to occur on 30 December 2016.

Development Update

192 units and 33 care beds are consented and currently in varying stages of construction.

Resource consent was obtained in August for the Rhodes on Cashmere development in Christchurch that includes 28 apartments and a combination of 33 care suites and care beds. Resource consent was also obtained for construction of 22 new villas on land acquired adjacent to Oakwoods in Nelson. Enabling works at both Rhodes on Cashmere and Oakwoods started in November.

Construction of 24 new apartments at Aria Bay in Auckland is progressing well and construction of 78 new apartments at Park Lane in Christchurch is due to commence this side of Christmas.

Operations

The investment in our people and operations continues with the view that enduring synergies will be delivered from associated efficiency and productivity improvements.

In recently completed Ministry of Health audits, four of Arvida’s care facilities were distinguished in achieving certification for a 4 year period. Standardised Arvida clinical policies and procedures are now in all villages.

The rollout of a resident management system and introduction of a rostering and time attendance system continues across the Group.

Dividends

The Directors approved a dividend of 1.1 cents per share amounting to $3.7 million for the September quarter. The dividend is partially imputed at 0.4 cents per share. A supplementary dividend of 0.18 cents per share will be paid to non-resident shareholders. The record date for the dividend is 8 December 2016 and payment will be made on 16 December 2016.

Outlook

Commenting on Arvida’s financial performance, Chairman Peter Wilson said, “we were pleased to announce a result well ahead of last year’s performance. We expect the group to continue to perform well with this momentum continuing for the full year.”

Footnotes

1 - Underlying Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and differs from NZ IFRS net profit after tax by replacing the fair value adjustment in investment property values with the Board’s estimate of realised components of movements in investment property value and to eliminate deferred tax and one-off costs.

2 - Calculated with reference to the weighted average number of shares on issue for the period.

- ENDS -

    Bethunes Investments Limited - Half Year Result
    9:24am, 29 Nov 2016 | HALFYR
  

  29 November 2016 

Interim Result Announcement

Bethunes Investments Limited (BIL) reported a loss for the six months ended 30 September 2016 of $111,962. The financial statements are attached with this announcement.

The Net Tangible Assets of BIL as at 30 September 2016 amounted to $598,967, or $0.005 per share.

Whilst required to present financial results from the prior comparable period, the only true comparative to the Company as at 30 September is the balance sheet as at 31 March 2016 as BIL disposed of all operating businesses in the year ended 31 March 2016.

The BIL Directors continued the process of winding up past operations and the previous trading subsidiary (BIL 2016 Limited) has all but settled one matter. We expect to conclude this favourably for the Company in the next few weeks.

Mossgreen continued to make instalments as part of the sales agreement with regard to Webb’s. The undiscounted receivable totals $360,000 as at 29 November 2016 – it should be noted that the receivable is discounted in the Company’s accounts in line with financial reporting standard requirements.

Over the past six months the Directors have studied a number of value creating opportunities and potential new investment opportunities and are pleased to report they have identified two potential investments, which the Company would like to undertake or increase exposure to. While we cannot provide specifics at this point in time due to confidentiality obligations and the fact that the investments remain incomplete proposals – a general outline is provided below: 

Investment A – is a consumer products company with iconic brands and no net debt, which BIL already holds an investment in. Should BIL increase its stake in this company it is the Director’s intention to pass through this company’s net dividend/s to BIL shareholders and thus make BIL a dividend-paying share as a result.

Investment B (at a less advanced stage) – is an agricultural based company, which BIL does not hold an investment in, where it is proposed BIL would be acquiring an equity interest at the Net Tangible Asset value based on market valuations. The assets include commercial real estate, a dairy farm, stock and associated equipment and dairy company shares. Based on information received to date this investment should be cash generative based on current forecasts and payout ratios, but more importantly will facilitate further investments into a part of the value chain that most investors cannot access at this point in time.

With these two investment options in front of BIL the Directors would like to signal it is BIL’s intention to raise up to NZ$ 12.5mln from shareholders before the end of Q2 2017. At this stage it is intended that this capital raise would be by way of a renounceable rights issue to give our existing shareholders the first opportunity to participate. However, we are aware that this capital raise will clearly require new shareholders to be found as well as the support of existing shareholders, and accordingly the Directors welcome preliminary expressions of interest.

We expect to be in a position to provide more details on these proposed investments in the capital raising documents to be prepared in connection with the intended capital raising.

    Reverse Listing Transaction with NZ Retail Property Group
    8:30am,  9 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  9 March 2017

NZX Announcement 

Reverse Listing Transaction with NZ Retail Property Group Limited 

BIL is pleased to announce that it has signed a non-binding conditional term sheet (Term Sheet) with Westgate Power Centre Limited (Westgate) and NZ Retail Property Group Limited (NZRPG). 

NZRPG, a privately owned property development, investment and management company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westgate.  Further information regarding NZRPG follows.

Based on the current asset values involved in the reverse listing, BIL believes this transaction, if approved, is likely to be the largest reverse listing to occur on the New Zealand capital markets.

Transaction Summary

The transaction will involve all of BIL’s assets (except the NZX Bond of NZ$ 75,000 and $25,000 in cash) being transferred into BIL’s wholly owned subsidiary, BIL 2016 Limited (New BIL). The shares of New BIL will then be distributed pro rata to all of BIL’s existing shareholders. New BIL will assume the name Bethunes Investments Limited.

The business of NZRPG will then be reverse listed into the resulting shell of BIL through BIL issuing shares to Westgate in exchange for all of the shares in NZRPG. BIL will then assume the name NZ Retail Property Group Limited.

Accordingly, the effect for BIL shareholders if the transaction is completed is that they will retain their current BIL shares which become an interest in NZRPG but will also, for no consideration, receive shares in New BIL which will be an interest in the same assets and business plan that BIL presently has.

Valuation

The initial indicative and non-binding estimates for the transaction are:

• The shares in NZRPG are estimated at approximately $400 million.

• The shares in Bethunes (less the assets and receivable held in BIL 2016 Limited) on a debt free basis valued at $1.0 million plus the NZX Bond of $75,000 and $25,000 cash.

Based on these valuations Westgate will hold approximately 99% of the share capital in BIL.  These values are however subject to final determination and agreement and may vary.

Conditions 

The transactions contemplated by the Term Sheet are conditional on:

• BIL conducting a due diligence investigation of NZRPG.
• Westgate conducting a due diligence investigation of BIL.  
• Entry into legally binding transaction documents between BIL and Westgate.
• Obtaining any necessary waivers from NZX that are required in order to proceed with the transaction.
• BIL obtaining all shareholder approvals that may be required to undertake the transactions, including under the Companies Act 1993, the Takeovers Code and the NZX Listing Rules.  

A notice of special meeting to approve the transactions, and all other required documentation, will be circulated to BIL shareholders in due course. Such documentation will include an independent report and appraisal report on the merits of the transaction as required under the Takeovers Code and the NZX Listing Rules. A profile document on the business of NZRPG will also circulated as required under the Listing Rules.

Timetable

Under the Term Sheet, BIL will seek to hold the required shareholders’ meeting by 30 June 2017 with the intention of completing the transactions shortly after such approvals are obtained.  

Reasons for the Transaction

As noted above the current business plan and assets of BIL will continue in New BIL which BIL shareholders will directly own. Accordingly completing the transactions can only add value for BIL shareholders as they will also own an interest in NZRPG. 

In addition, NZRPG is meeting the costs of the transactions and BIL is only liable to pay its share of the costs if shareholders vote against the transaction, BIL terminates the transaction without cause or BIL materially breaches the transaction documents. Accordingly the Board can only see upside for shareholders in undertaking the transaction and believes it is in their best interests.

The BIL Board is investigating either re-listing New BIL following the transactions or placing New BIL on an alternative share trading platform to retain some liquidity in New BIL. A decision on this will be made at a later time but prior to shareholders being asked to vote on the transaction.

For and on behalf of the Board,

Christopher Swasbrook
Chairman

About New Zealand Retail Property Group (NZRPG)

NZRPG is one of New Zealand’s largest privately held retail ownership, management and development companies with over 100,000 square meters of leasable space in the portfolio. The total portfolio of mixed-use assets is valued at significantly higher than the transaction value of $400 million. For over 30 years, NZRPG has been completing development and construction projects across New Zealand, solidifying their position as a long-standing player in the New Zealand property development market. 

With a core specialisation in retail, NZRPG actively invests in the development of the long term property assets that are owned in the portfolio and that offer the opportunity to add value through mixed use expansion, development and redevelopment. The property portfolio includes three strategic Town Centres located in Auckland and a Shopping Centre in Tauranga. 

The intention of NZ Retail Property Group is to grow the company’s investment portfolio through the strategic development of existing retail centres into planned town environments and the development of mixed use assets that derive the highest value per square meter. 

Historically income generated from property assets has, to a large part, been utilised to fund the ongoing development, planning and design processes necessary to ensure the long term opportunity for these town centres. As a result, NZRPG is now uniquely positioned with a significant and long term development pipeline, which will provide long term income and value growth.  NZRPG is seeking capital to realize these plans and a reverse listing is intended to support securing new capital.

NZRPG is presenting to investors the opportunity to take part in one of the most significant retail property development pipelines in New Zealand. The company is seeking capital to embark on the next phase of its pipeline, which includes one of New Zealand’s biggest mixed use property development opportunities – Westgate town centre. 

In addition to the ongoing completion of the 48.5 hectare Westgate Town Centre, both the Milford Centre and Highbury centre on Auckland’s North Shore are undergoing retail development with a residential overlay. The success of these developments is underpinned by the expansive urban town planning that is reshaping Auckland. 

These growth opportunities include the provision of residential overlays to all the town centre properties (Milford, Highbury and Westgate) which will both enhance the retail performance of the centres and allow for significant tranches of capital to be recycled into the core business. The Milford development plan is underway with completion due in Mid-2019.

    Study Results - BLIS K12 Probiotic- Strep Throat
    2:26pm, 13 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  MEDIA RELEASE

February 13, 2017.

Study results show K12 probiotic helps prevent rheumatic fever

As the Government launches a new rheumatic fever awareness campaign this week, results from a recent European clinical trial show that the daily use of a Kiwi-developed oral probiotic, BLIS K12 TM, is associated with a significant and ongoing reduction in throat infections and other streptococcal diseases among children.1

Rheumatic fever is a complication of a throat infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Left untreated, the bacteria can cause serious health problems, including heart failure or heart valve damage. Children and young people from Pacific and Māori communities are the most vulnerable. 

The Government’s $65 million programme to reduce the number of new rheumatic fever cases by two-thirds by June 2017 is falling behind its target and the goal might not be reached till 2019 or later. 

BLIS K12 or Streptococcus salivarius K12 is the world’s first probiotic for the mouth and throat and is hostile to the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of throat infections in humans. 

“BLIS K12 populates the mouth and throat with a beneficial strain of Streptococcus salivarius which not only crowds out the bad bacteria, but produces antimicrobial peptides that add a level of protection against them coming back.  As this latest study shows, it is effective in preventing streptococcal throat infections.  

We believe this probiotic should be considered, alongside other strategies, as one way of reducing streptococcal sore throats and the possible complications such as rheumatic fever in our communities,” explains BLIS Technologies chief technology officer, Dr John Hale. 

The study, published in the Drug Healthcare and Patient Safety Journal by a team from Velleja Research led by Dr Francesco Di Pierro in Italy, ran an observational study of 124 schoolchildren in 2014.  The treated group of 48 children with a recent history of recurrent pharyngeal streptococcal disease (sore throats) received a daily oral dose of BLIS K12 for 90 days.  A control group of 76 children with no recent history of sore throats who were not given BLIS K12 was also monitored. 

During the trial the incidence of throat infections (streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis) was reduced by 90 percent in the treated group compared to the previous (pre-treatment) year and was lower than the untreated low risk control group. 
The authors reported that the results agree with previous findings that BLIS K12 offers benefits to children in reducing streptococcal disease along with some other throat and ear infections.2

BLIS K12 is present in ThroatGuard Lozenges and ToddlerProtect powder, both of which are available over-the-counter from pharmacies and online at www.blis.co.nz

    Blis Technologies Limited- NZX Release
    9:18am, 20 Feb 2017 | FORECAST
  

  Updated guidance

Blis Technologies reports that it now does not expect to meet its previous guidance of net profit before tax in excess of $700,000. However, the company does expect to record a maiden profit for the year to 31 March 2017.

Forecast total trading revenue has reduced significantly in the months of February and March.  The reduction is due to changes in buying patterns by three major customers to reduce their product inventory compared with what had been forecast. For two cases, this is a result of change of ownership. It is important to note that the changes do not reflect any change in underlying customer demand but instead reflect changes in timing of purchases by these customers.

The company now expects trading revenue to be around $6.5m for the year to 31 March 2017.

Recognition of tax asset based on the move to profitability

To date the company has not recognised deferred income tax assets.  A decision has been taken to recognise a portion of these tax assets in the current financial year reflecting the company’s transition to profitable operations.  The tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised and that shareholder continuity requirements are met.  Accordingly, a tax asset of approximately $1.3m is expected to be recognised.

Brian Watson 
Chief Executive

    FY17 earnings guidance update
    8:30am,  7 Feb 2017 | FORECAST
  

  The Board of Directors of Cavalier Corporation advises that the normalised profit after tax for the 16/17 year is now forecast to be close to break-even, below the $3.0 to $5.0 million normalised profit after tax guidance given to the market in November last year.

The reduction in forecast reflects difficult trading conditions in Australia and an increasingly depressed wool market.

Market conditions in Australia appear to be weakening, with very soft trading in December and January resulting in a revision of Australian sales volumes for the next six months.  Weaker Australian economic conditions have also pushed up the NZD/AUD cross rate, another factor adversely impacting on the forecast revision. However, the Company’s belief in Australia as a key market, where opportunities for growth are significant, remains unchanged.

While the recent significant drop in the wool price is good for Cavalier in the longer term, the depressed wool market impacts volumes through the newly-merged scouring operation and the profitability of our wool buying business in the short term. The duration of China’s reduced demand for wool is uncertain.

This year, Cavalier has invested heavily in consolidating its manufacturing operations and reinvigorating its brand. We have introduced new products late in the last calendar year and began updating and modernising our in-store presence and consumer-facing marketing material. These investments will deliver improved results in the 17/18 year. The significantly reduced wool price and higher NZD/USD exchange rate on the cost of carpet manufacturing will also benefit the results. Improved returns from the merged scouring operation are also expected to flow into the 17/18 year as synergies are progressively realised from the consolidation of operations.

In summary, the 16/17 year is a year of investment, consolidation and restructuring.  We are confident that the benefits of the work done this year and changes in the macro environment will flow through into improved results in future years.

    Preliminary announcement of December 2016 half year results
    9:35am, 17 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  Directors’ Report
For the six months ended 31 December 2016

The half-year results reported today are in line with what the Directors expected when they recently announced that the normalised profit after tax for the 2016/17 year is forecast to be close to break-even.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Consolidated Income Statement
Six months ended 31 December
Unaudited
(figures in 000's for six months ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015)

Revenue $84,278; $98,422

EBIT (Normalised) (1) (1,183); 4,268
Net interest expense (1,489); (1,961)
Share of equity-accounted investee profit (Normalised after tax) (1) 88; 985
Profit/(Loss) before tax (Normalised) (1) (2,584); 3,292
Income tax 708; (876)
Profit/(Loss) after tax (Normalised) (1) (1,876); 2,416
Restructuring costs (1,833); (936)
Net gain on merger of equity-accounted investee 3,740; 0
Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment 0; 2,035
Profit after tax (GAAP) $31; $3,515

Earnings per share (cents) (Normalised) (1) (2.7); 3.5

Earnings per share (cents) (GAAP) 0.0; 5.1

(1) Normalised is a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) measure that provides what the Directors believe to be a more meaningful view of the underlying financial performance of the Group. A reconciliation between GAAP and normalised earnings together with further commentary on the disclosure of non-GAAP financial information are attached.

Last year’s focus was debt reduction, inventory rationalisation and the restructuring of administration and sales functions.  Our focus in recent months has been significant investment in the core business by consolidating manufacturing activities and re-invigorating the Cavalier Bremworth brand.

The short term cost of these essential reinvestment activities has impacted the current half year results, however they will progressively and significantly benefit the Company going forward. Other market factors such as increased wool price and the stronger USD have also adversely impacted the first half results.

The Group reports a break-even position for the half year (compared with $3.5m in 2015/16). Adjusting for the abnormal gain from the scour merger of $3.7m and transitional costs relating to the consolidation of Cavalier’s wool spinning operation of $1.8m, the normalised loss for the first six months is $1.9m compared with a normalised gain of $2.4m last financial year.

FINANCIAL POSITION

The increase in net bank debt of $5.9m since the year-end reflects $6.0m of restructuring costs and $2.1m capital gains tax payment resulting from the sale of the Sydney warehouse in the last financial year. With these large one-off costs now behind us, debt will once again start to fall. In January, the Company received a dividend of $3.25m from Cavalier Wool Holdings Ltd (CWH) as a result of the scour merger, which has reduced debt.

In the last six months, management has improved the Company’s inventory profile and reduced inventory by $8.5m. This has been achieved while it was also manufacturing the additional inventory required to support new products in the market.

Total assets and equity have remained in line with previous year-end.

CASH FLOWS

Net cash outflows from operations were $4.8m for the first six months, reflecting the large costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing and the capital gains tax payment referred to above.

SEGMENT REVIEWS

Carpet Business

The sale of the Ontera carpet tile business in 2015/16 and the associated carpet tile revenue forgone is the main driver of the fall in revenue.

The NZ market has remained reasonably buoyant, however Australia has been much softer than anticipated particularly in the last two months.  We are working hard with our retailers to stimulate sales.

We have now closed our Christchurch plant and moved the felting operation to Wanganui. Woollen yarn spinning is now conducted entirely out of the Napier plant. We acknowledge the management and staff of these operations for making this happen.

The carpet segment result for the first six months has been affected by a number of factors including:

• Significant restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of spinning operations;
• Higher wool price compared with the previous year;
• Higher USD impacting negatively on cost of synthetic yarn purchases; and
• Increased marketing costs in respect of the new Cavalier Bremworth World of Difference marketing campaign.

All of the above factors that have negatively impacted the six months (and the full year forecast) will either not repeat or have turned in our favour, with the benefits to come through in 2017/18.The significant gains from consolidating our manufacturing operations will also be progressively realised in the 2017/18 year.

Because there is about a six month lag between the purchase of wool and the manufacture and sale of carpet, we will not see the benefit from the current drop in wool price until 2017/18. Conversely, the high wool price that prevailed in the previous year is adversely impacting current profitability.

Wool Business

Our wool business comprises our wool buying operation, Elco Direct, and a 27.5% interest in the enlarged CWH wool scouring business post its merger with the wool scouring operations of New Zealand Wool Services International Ltd (NZWSI). This is to be compared with the 50% we held previously in a smaller pre-merger entity.

This year, both our wool-related businesses have been adversely impacted by the dramatic drop in wool price which has caught many in the industry by surprise and is due almost entirely to a lack of demand out of China.

Elco Direct, like many wool traders and exporters, had to exit stocks in a falling market and this impacted negatively on margins. The current price of wool is very low and growers are reluctant to sell at these levels.  As a result, the flow of wool has abated significantly, with a high percentage of wool passed in at auction.  Elco Direct has had three very strong years, but profits are down in the last six months reflecting the current challenging operating environment.  Once demand returns and wool price stabilises, Elco Direct will be in a better position to buy and sell wool at a consistent margin.

After over two years of Court proceedings, the merger of CWH with the wool scouring operations of NZWSI was finally approved by the Court of Appeal in December. The purpose of the merger is to safeguard the wool scouring industry in New Zealand and our reduced share in a much bigger entity will be beneficial for the Company in the long term.

For the first six months, volume through the scour is considerably down on that for the same period last year.  The total wool clip has not changed dramatically, but at current low prices, growers and exporters are holding off committing to selling and scouring wool. We are confident that the wool will eventually come on to market and be scoured once pricing and demand settle at their new levels.

The consolidation of the scouring businesses is expected to take a year to complete. In the short term, CWH will experience some inefficiencies while equipment is being moved and reconfigured.

EARNINGS OUTLOOK

The Directors reiterate that their forecast for 2016/17 remains unchanged. We expect the result for 2016/17 to be close to breakeven on a normalised tax-paid basis.

2016/17 is a year of investment in the long term future of the Company, and we remain confident that the benefits of the work done this year together with changes in the macro environment will flow through into improved results. 

DIVIDENDS

The Directors have previously advised that as soon as we are in a position to confirm an ongoing improvement in underlying performance and we have our debt firmly under control, we will resume dividend payments. While good progress has been made, we are not there yet. The NZD:AUD exchange rate and the weakness in the Australian economy remain a concern to Cavalier as an exporter. As a consequence, no dividend is being paid at this time.

S R Bootten, Director

    Market Update
    1:10pm,  7 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Announcement - 7 April 2017
 
The Board of Bethunes Investments Limited (BIL) met today to review the past year. KPMG our auditors have started work on the annual audit and the Directors expect to issue BIL's audited results to shareholders before the end of May 2017.
 
In an effort to lower costs for the year ahead, the Board has today appointed Christopher Swasbrook - Chairman of BIL with additional executive responsibilities. This arrangement ceases: (i) a director’s fee paid to Mr. Swasbrook last year; and (ii) the contract with Elevation Capital Management Limited for analytical services. The company has two investment ideas developed by Elevation Capital and Mr. Swasbrook that it is currently exploring outside of the announced reverse listing of New Zealand Retail Property Group (NZRPG).
 
As indicated previously, the company will require additional capital to execute on any future investments and shareholders can expect to receive an update at the Annual Shareholder Meeting (ASM), which is expected to coincide with a Special Meeting for the NZRPG transaction.

Ends.
 
Aaron Titter
Independent Director

    Changes to Board of Directors
    12:45pm,  5 Apr 2017 | DIRECTOR
  

  Airwork announces a number of changes to its Board of Directors.

Mike Daniel has stood down as Chairman of the Board but remains an independent director of the Company.  Mr Jie Wu has been appointed as Chairman.  Mr Wu is Chairman of Airwork’s majority shareholder, Zhejiang Rifa Holding Group Co. Ltd and was appointed to the Board upon completion of the recent partial takeover.  In addition, Simon Craddock, Martin Gray and Mark Pitt have been appointed as directors and Rob Flannagan has resigned.

Simon Craddock is an experienced executive with a background in corporate strategy, operations and performance improvement with Air New Zealand, Deloitte, and Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare.  He specialises in strategic planning and transformational change initiatives and has worked across the aviation, healthcare, tourism, defence, manufacturing, and financial services sectors.  Simon sits on the board of the Public Trust and the Harvard Business School Association of NZ, and is a member of the Institute of Directors. 

Martin Gray has over 20 years of corporate finance experience in Asia, New Zealand and Europe and headed M&amp;A services for EY in New Zealand.  His key areas of expertise include mergers and acquisitions, business disposals, finance raisings, project finance, independent expert reports, valuations, and due diligence, with substantial listed and private company lead advisory experience. Martin holds a Bachelor of Commerce and a Diploma in Business (Finance) from the University of Auckland, and the CA qualification through Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. 

Mark Pitt has 25 years’ experience as a pilot, initially as an international military pilot and later as a domestic airline pilot instructor.  He was the Chief Executive of Air New Zealand subsidiary Mount Cook Airline, Managing Director and Chair of Virgin Samoa and, most recently, Managing Director and Chief Executive of Virgin Australia New Zealand.  Mark is currently a director of Airways, New Zealand’s air navigation service provider, and has also served as a director of a number of Boards including Virgin Australia New Zealand and the Board of Airline Representatives New Zealand Incorporated (BARNZ).  He is owner and director of distribution company Quinn International Ltd and manufacturing and distribution company G&amp;M Pty Ltd in Australia, and runs a consultancy called Frontseat which specialises in leadership and marketing.

As required by NZX Main Board Listing Rule 3.3.3(b), the Board has determined that Mr Craddock and Mr Pitt are not independent directors, and that Mr Gray is an independent director.  In accordance with the NZX Main Board Listing Rule 3.3.6, the new directors will retire and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the 2017 annual meeting.

As advised on 20 March, Rob Flannagan had notified Airwork of his intention to resign.  He has now formally tendered his resignation, effective from today.   Rob joined the Board in 2013, immediately prior to the listing of the Companies shares on NZX, and he has served as Chairman of the Audit Committee over that period.  The Board acknowledges Rob’s contribution to Airwork through its foundation years as a listed company and wishes him well for the future.

Yours faithfully

Chris Hart
Chief Executive

    AWF Madison announces retirement of Associate Director
    12:03pm, 14 Dec 2016 | DIRECTOR
  

  NZX RELEASE

14 December 2016

Rachel Hopkins, who joined the Board of the AWF Madison Group as an Associate Director, in May 2015, under the Institute of Directors’ Future Directors program (the “Program”), has retired from the Board of the Company as her tenure under the Program has come to an end. 
Run by the Institute of Directors, the Program provides a basis where the next generation of directors receive mentoring, advice, and practical insight into the boardroom, while host boards get a new perspective and expertise on emerging issues like sustainability and social media. 
AWF Madison Group chair Ross Keenan said: “In my view Rachel certainly contributed to the Board in a manner that we had hoped for, in a style that was well respected by my colleagues and me”. 
As a result of Rachel’s positive contribution, AWF Madison Group proposes continuing to participate in the Program, and will work with executive search firm Hobson Leavy, who undertook the search previously, to find the right person for the role. 
“Future Directors is a fantastic opportunity to bridge the generation gap in governance,” says AWF Madison Group’s Simon Hull. “We’re very proud to be involved and can’t speak highly enough of the whole process.”

  NZX Release

25 January 2017
AWF MADISON GROUP LIMITED (NZX: AWF) – 
The Board of AWF was informed at its meeting today, that Alex Park, the COO of subsidiary AWF Limited (the “Company”), has indicated that he wishes to pursue other interests, and has, accordingly, resigned his position with effect from March 2017.
Alex, who was appointed in May 2015, has contributed significantly to the Company’s operational positioning and has been instrumental in, amongst others, the implementation of new systems and driving change towards a more sustainable operational structure, than existed previously.
Simon Bennett, the CEO of AWF, said of Alex: “…he has done an excellent job in an often challenging environment; and has created a platform for further refinement of the Company’s structure, positioning it well for the future...”
Simon said that with Alex’s resignation, he would be reviewing the Company’s management structure and would be considering the most appropriate one for that business going forward, which may, initially, include a greater personal involvement, until that structure is finalised.

    APPOINTMENT OF SUBSIDIARY (AWF LIMITED) GENERAL MANAGERS
    2:58pm,  3 Feb 2017 | OFFICE
  

  NZX Release

3 February 2017

AWF MADISON GROUP LIMITED (NZX: AWF) – APPOINTMENT OF SUBSIDIARY (AWF LIMITED) GENERAL MANAGERS.

On 25 January 2017, AWF announced the resignation of AWF Limited’s COO, with effect from March 2017; and CEO, Simon Bennett, would be reviewing the Company’s management structure, in light of this. 

There is ongoing review and structural adaptations to the operational structure of the business, in order to take advantage of the Company’s growth nationally and the ever-changing landscape of the labour market.  The Board of AWF, on the CEO’s advice, considers it appropriate, at this time, to divide operations geographically – into a Northern region and a Southern region. Each region will report to a General Manager, who will report to the CEO. “This will allow for a greater strategic business focus and flexibility, drive operational and systems improvement to support the business as it grows”; said Simon.

With effect from March 2017, the Northern region will be managed by Fleur Board, who is a 30 year veteran of the recruitment services industry, the past 8 of which have been with AWF.  During her career spanning both Australia and New Zealand with global and national providers, Fleur has held senior operational and sales management roles with a primary focus on market share growth and development of greenfield opportunities. Fleur will be based in Auckland. The Southern Region will be managed by Donna Lynch, based in Palmerston North. Donna has a wealth of operational experience gained over 20 years in senior management roles in sales and marketing in fields of human capital, culminating in a national leadership role for a global recruitment company.

Simon said “I am very excited to announce the appointment of Donna and particularly pleased to be able to promote Fleur from within the organisation. “

Simon also advised the appointment of Jannine Mountford as CFO-designate, with effect from 27 February. During the transition period, until 16 June, Jannine will assume responsibility for a number of Group corporate functions which will be incorporated into the CFO function, as part of the Group’s growth strategy and building internal management capability. 
Jannine has many years’ experience in various accounting and financial leadership roles, at senior levels, both national and international. In her most recent role, she was the CFO/GM Corporate Services at the New Zealand Rugby Union, where her many and varied achievements included capital raising, business process improvement, risk management and Human Resource practices across the NZRU.
“I am thrilled to be working with Jannine; and I look forward to the financial, strategic and commercial leadership experience she brings to the business at this time”, said Simon.

    Augusta Capital Increases NPT Stake to 18.85% 
    9:37am,  7 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE
7 April 2017

Augusta Capital Increases Stake to 18.85% Ahead of NPT Special Meeting 

Augusta Capital today announces it has increased its shareholding in NPT Limited (NPT) to 18.85% following the acquisition of a further 9.59% stake in NPT from other shareholders.  The total amount to be paid was $10,559,674, with settlement to occur on Tuesday, 11 April 2017.  Following that, Augusta Capital will be the largest shareholder in NPT.  

Augusta Capital Managing Director Mark Francis says: “This week’s acquisition of shares in NPT is consistent with our long-standing plan to grow our funds management business and significantly, it strengthens our position ahead of the NPT Special Meeting on 21 April 2017.”

“Having now carefully assessed the Kiwi Property proposal being recommended by the NPT Board – we remain firmly of a view that it is not in the interest of NPT shareholders.”

“While we respect Kiwi Property the current proposal is heavily skewed in their favour – falling well short of what we consider to be fair and reasonable for NPT shareholders.

“Augusta intends to vote against the Kiwi Property proposal and is aware of a number of other shareholders who have indicated their intention to vote against the Kiwi Property Proposal.  We would encourage all NPT shareholders to seek independent specialist advice concerning its merits before casting their vote,” Mr Francis adds.

“We believe the current Board is completely out of touch with its shareholders in recommending this deal, and Augusta Capital will also be voting for change through resolutions two to six, to remove two of the current board members, noting that the previous Chairman has already stepped down,” Mr Francis concludes.

Augusta Capital wishes to remind fellow NPT shareholders that the deadline for voting papers reaching Link Market Services is 11.00am on Wednesday 19th April 2017.

    Aorere exclusive option expires
    3:32pm,  3 Mar 2017 | MINE
  

  3 March 2017
NZX Market Announcement
AORERE EXCLUSIVE OPTION EXPIRES ON NEVADA PROJECT 
 Aorere advises its exclusive option to acquire American Innovative Minerals (“AIM”) in Nevada has expired.
 AIM, which holds the rights to the Fondaway Canyon gold project as well as a number of other exploration prospects, has advised it has entered into an alternative proposal, which it expects to settle in March.
 Managing director Chris Castle said Aorere remained interested in the Nevada assets, and will keep a watching brief on this transaction given it has yet to be finalised.
Aorere has worked over the past 10 months to assess the potential of the Nevada resources and sought to find partners with capital to invest, achieving three extensions of an exclusivity arrangement.  Over the past couple of months Aorere sought additional capital from shareholders to finance the ongoing costs of securing the AIM assets.
During the extension periods Aorere carried out due diligence, completed metallurgy studies, updated the independent resource report and identified a third party to fund the acquisition.  That party ultimately did not conclude its arrangements.
While there is still a possibility the current sale of AIM to a third party will not be concluded, Aorere is disappointed the significant efforts made so far have not resulted in a deal.
Aorere’s research identified a significant increase in the mineral resource estimate to 1,069,000 ounces at a gold grade of 6.3 grams per tonne on a combined indicated and inferred basis.  Detailed technical assessment and new resource modelling demonstrated this project has the potential to become a significant mine in resource-rich, mine-friendly Nevada, USA.
Mr Castle said Aorere would inform the market once AIM advises the result of its current proposal.
Regards,
Chris Castle
Managing Director

    Aorere provides update on Nevada gold project 
    8:30am,  7 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  7 March 2017

NZX Market Announcement

AORERE CONFIRMS NEVADA PROJECT EXPECTED TO GO TO ANOTHER PARTY

The Nevada gold prospects Aorere Resources has investigated over the past year have conditionally been sold to another party.

Vancouver based Canarc Resource Corp has announced it has executed a binding letter of agreement with American Innovative Minerals (“AIM”), owner of 10 gold properties in Nevada, plus other interests.

Under the terms of the agreement, Canarc will pay US$2 million cash for 100 per cent of AIM’s outstanding securities or a 100 per cent interest in AIM’s assets. Canarc paid a deposit of US$200,000 on signing the agreement, to be credited against the purchase price on completing the acquisition, which Canarc expects to achieve by March 31.

Canarc described the acquisition as an attractive portfolio of gold exploration properties in Nevada with historic gold resources and significant exploration potential at a low acquisition cost in the prolific and mining friendly jurisdiction of Nevada.  Canarc’s announcement regarding the purchase refers to the work undertaken by Aorere.  

The purchase includes what Aorere believes is the key asset of Fondaway Canyon, an advanced stage gold property previously explored and mined in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, with indicated resources of 409,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold and inferred resources of 660,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 6.4 g/t gold, using a cut-off grade of 3.43 g/t gold. 

Managing director Chris Castle said Aorere would continue to watch the transaction given it has yet to be finalised.  Over the past year Aorere assessed the potential of the Nevada resources and sought to find partners with capital to invest, achieving two extensions of an exclusivity arrangement to carry out due diligence, complete metallurgy studies, update the independent resource report and identify a third party to fund the acquisition.  That party ultimately did not conclude its arrangements.

    Aorere's Asian Minerals announces changes 
    4:28pm, 23 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  New Zealand Exchange Limited 
P.O. Box 2959 
Wellington

23 March 2017 

Dear Sir, 

Aorere’s Asian Minerals announces management and board changes         

Asian Mineral Resources (“ASN”) is Aorere’s second largest investment. This shareholding represents 24% of Widespread’s total assets at ASN’s current market value of 2.5 cents in Canada.     

ASN made the following announcement in Canada overnight which signals a period of likely change for the company. The good news is that we are still represented on the board continuing a 17 year involvement by Aorere with this company.  
 
For and on behalf of the Board,

Chris D Castle
Managing Director 
Aorere Resources Limited 

Asian Mineral Resources Limited: Management and Board Changes
TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - March 22, 2017) - Asian Mineral Resources Limited (""AMR"" or the ""Company"") (TSX VENTURE:ASN) is pleased to announce changes to the management and Board of the company. The changes to the management and Board are designed to reposition the company to more effectively and efficiently advance the follow-up on the advanced-stage nickel exploration prospects on AMR's tenements in the prolific Son Da rift zone in Vietnam. 
Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Duncan Blount has today been appointed Chief Executive Officer of AMR. Mr Blount is a highly experienced executive with over 10 years of investment experience focused on the natural resources sector. Most recently, Mr. Blount was Head of Emerging and Frontier Market Commodities for RWC Partners, responsible for developing their commodity and natural resources portfolio strategy. Mr Blount holds a BA in Language and World Trade from Samford University and an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global Management.
Mr. Blount takes over the CEO role from Mr. Evan Spencer with immediate effect, though Mr. Spencer will remain with the Company during a transition period.
Mr Robin Widdup, Non-Executive Chairman of AMR stated, ""On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Evan for his tireless efforts in successfully steering the company through the completion of construction and operational ramp up of AMR's Ban Phuc Nickel Mine in Northern Vietnam through a very tough economic environment. Under Evan's leadership the Ban Phuc mine and processing facility transformed into a modern world class mining operation and an industry leader in Vietnam. We wish him well for the future. We welcome Mr Blount to the company and look forward to his leadership in realizing the full potential of the Ban Phuc project.""

Chief Financial Officer
In keeping with the transition of the company to an exploration focused company, Mr. Sean Duffy will be leaving AMR at the end of March 2017 and Ms. Paula Kember, currently Corporate Secretary, will take on the role of CFO and Corporate Secretary.
Mr. Evan Spencer, outgoing CEO of AMR stated ""Sean's financial leadership and guidance of the company through historically low nickel prices was a key contributing factor to AMR's reputation as a pioneer and a key industry leader in Vietnam. The management and board of AMR wish Sean well for his future.""
Board of Directors
In accordance with the intent to transition AMR into an exploration company the AMR Board has also been streamlined to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and suitability for delivering on the exploration and development potential of AMR's exploration portfolio. In line with this restructuring Mr. Jim Askew (Non-Executive Chairman), Mr. Mike Brown and Mr. Evgenij Iorich did not seek re-election to the board of AMR at the annual AGM held on the 6th March 2017. 
The Board currently consists of Mr. Robin Widdup (Chairman), Mr. Chris Castle and Mr. Martyn Buttenshaw.
Mr. Evan Spencer, outgoing CEO of AMR stated ""We thank Jim, Mike and Evgenij for the significant contributions that they have made to the company during their tenure, successfully guiding the company from early stage exploration project to a modern world-class mining operation."" 
ABOUT AMR
AMR owns and operates one of the world's few sources of nickel sulphide ore, and is exploring for additional high-grade nickel assets in Vietnam. AMR commenced commercial production from its 90%- owned Ban Phuc Nickel Mine in Vietnam in mid-2013. As of 30 June 2016, the Ban Phuc Nickel Mine has produced a total of c. 20,000 tonnes of nickel and c. 10,000 tonnes of copper contained in concentrate, plus a cobalt by-product since the beginning of its mine life. Mining and processing operations at Ban Phuc were suspended in September 2016 and operations were transitioned to a care and maintenance scenario. In addition to in and near-mine expansion projects, Ban Phuc provides a platform from which AMR can continue to focus on developing a new nickel camp within its 150km2 of concessions located throughout the highly-prolific Song Da rift zone, where AMR has a number of advanced-stage nickel exploration targets. 
For further details on AMR, please refer to the technical report entitled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report - Ban Phuc Nickel Project"" dated February 15, 2013 available on SEDAR or the AMR website www.asianmineralres.com.

  MEDIA RELEASE

For immediate release

16 March 2017

Contact to offer new rewards with AA Smartfuel

Contact Energy Limited (Contact) announces they will commence a new rewards offer with AA Smartfuel and will not continue its partnership with Fly Buys, which will end on 6 May 2017. 

“Our customers have told us that when it comes to rewards they want a more instant and generous rewards programme. Our customers want value discounts and cash back in their wallets, and as a result we will be introducing an exciting new suite of customer reward options in the coming months”, says Contact’s Chief Customer Officer, Vena Crawley.
 
“For us it’s about continually enhancing the great service and value we can provide our customers, and part of this includes providing more instant rewards relating to goods they buy regularly in their everyday lives, rather than reward options which may expire before they can utilise them.” 
 
Contact will introduce the new rewards offers in the coming weeks, communicating firstly with our customers how they can easily start earning AA Smartfuel discounts and save money.

    EROAD launches Electronic Logging Device in US
    9:40am, 27 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  EROAD launches Electronic Logging Device in US

27 February 2017 Auckland Transport technology service provider EROAD (NZX:ERD) has launched its in-cab, hardware-based Electronic Logging Device (ELD) to the US market.

EROAD’s ELD was announced today at US conference ATA TMC, the American Trucking Associations’ Annual Meeting &amp; Transport Technology Exhibition in Nashville, TN. The EROAD ELD has also been submitted to the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) for inclusion on the US government’s register of providers offering services to meet new federal rules for electronically recording drivers’ hours of service. EROAD’s ELD registration is imminent.

Once published by the FMCSA, EROAD’s ELD is expected to be the 28th device on the register, and the first to offer permanent in-cab hardware as part of a comprehensive solution. The other 27 devices on the register offer less comprehensive, app-based services using a smart phone or mobile computer case without a permanent, in-cab device. EROAD’s major competitors offering in-cab hardware are yet to have ELD devices published on the FMCSA register.

Trucking firms in the US have until December 2017 to comply with a federal regulation requiring drivers to record their record of duty status electronically in a way that is tamper-resistant and readily transferrable to enforcement officers – a measure that will improve not only compliance with hours of service requirements but also the overall health and safety of fleets. EROAD has also initiated independent, third-party verification of its ELD to provide assurance to the industry that its system is compliant, best-in-class, and operationally easy to use.

Chief Executive Steven Newman said that completing a compliant ELD for the US had been a major research and development focus for the company. He was delighted to be again leading in the global provision of technology and to have achieved a milestone that the company had set itself.

“App-based ELD solutions face a number of issues including poor Bluetooth, or loss of connectivity, battery dependence, and a lack of permanent connection to the truck. If a driver misplaces, drops, or forgets their smartphone or tablet, they won’t be able to drive. All of these issues are overcome by a fixed in-cab device,” said Mr Newman.

“With the new federal regulations, having a compliant ELD is critical for most customers looking for a fleet management or electronic tax reporting solution,” he said. “Today’s launch means we are in a position to begin selling our ELD offer in the US market as planned by March, 2017.

“In parallel with completing a compliant comprehensive ELD solution, EROAD has continued to build sales and marketing capability in the US which is now under the experienced leadership of Norm Ellis, who previously led sales and marketing for one of the US’s largest telematics companies, Omnitracs,” said Mr Newman.  

He said that a significant advantage for customers was that EROAD’s ELD service was offered from its single, integrated platform, capable of also providing electronic WMT (Weight-Mile Tax) and electronic IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement) reporting, as well as sophisticated fleet management.

“Customers can meet and manage their tax and health and safety compliance commitments all in one service, as well as improving productivity and reducing cost through our fleet management and driver behaviour services,” he said.
Launching its in-cab ELD system continues EROAD’s success at world-leading technology solutions. In 2009, EROAD introduced the world’s first nationwide electronic road user charging (RUC) system in New Zealand. It then launched in 2013 the US’s first electronic WMT service in Oregon, and has now introduced the US’s first compliant in-cab ELD. In early 2016, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) selected EROAD as its heavy vehicle technology provider for the California Road Charge Pilot, the US’s largest road charge pilot, running for nine months from July2016, to investigate new technology in road charging options for possible replacement of or in addition to California’s fuel tax. 

About EROAD
EROAD modernises road charging and compliance for road transport by replacing paper-based systems with easy-to-use electronic systems. The company is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand, and listed on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). Its US business is based in Portland, Oregon, serving customers with vehicles operating in every US mainland state, growing outward in concentration from the Northwest. In 2009 EROAD introduced the world’s first nationwide electronic road user charging (eRUC) system in New Zealand and, in 2017, more than 50% of heavy transport RUC is expected to be collected electronically, representing a rapid transition to e-commerce on a voluntary, industry-led basis, due to the cost-savings and benefits to customers. EROAD is also a leading provider of health and safety compliance services, including vehicle management and driver behaviour and performance measures.

    EROAD launches vehicle inspection mobile app in New Zealand

  EROAD launches vehicle inspection mobile app in New Zealand
 

2 March 2017 Auckland Transport technology service provider EROAD (NZX:ERD) today launched its pre- and post-trip safety inspection checks for commercial vehicles with its EROAD Inspect mobile application. 

EROAD CEO Steven Newman said the app was developed to help customers meet increasingly stringent health and safety obligations — a pressure transport operators are facing globally. 

“Keeping vehicles and assets safely maintained is a complex problem for our customers,” Mr Newman said. “We’re delighted to be helping solve that problem with a simple, elegant solution that they can customise to suit the vehicles in their fleets, to improve safety and reduce the administrative costs of manual inspections.”

EROAD Inspect eliminates paper, and a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to inspections. It enables operators to assign configurable inspection templates to a vehicle or asset. It also automatically records and saves the information input by drivers, providing an accurate record of inspections that operators can rely on for safety compliance.

EROAD Inspect guides drivers through inspections, and allows them to submit reports electronically. It interfaces with EROAD’s web application, Depot, with exception-based reporting that shows vehicle managers or maintenance staff back at the office items that have failed an inspection or require attention. 

Configurable templates mean drivers can select an inspection type – truck, tractor, vehicle or equipment – and assign it to a vehicle in Depot. 

“With web access to the information, it makes it easy for fleet managers to stay ahead of maintenance to keep vehicles in prime operating condition. Plus, clear records exist of all checks to demonstrate an operators’ care and attention in looking after their vehicles and their drivers,” Mr Newman said. 

He said the app would be useful not only for heavy vehicle operators but to anyone operating a vehicle or a fleet of vehicles in their business.

Changes in New Zealand health and safety law, which took effect a year ago this April, mean vehicles that are used for work are considered workplaces, and must offer a safe working environment for drivers, the community and other road users. 

“We see a wide scope for this product because it isn’t just the big trucks that need regular inspection checks,” he said.

Mr Newman said EROAD intended to offer EROAD Inspect in the US market also in FY2018, with the company’s R&amp;D increasingly being aimed at applications and new services that could be offered across a number of markets.

EROAD Inspect is available now for Apple and Android mobile devices.

EROAD’s device is the first on the register to offer permanent in-cab hardware as part of a comprehensive solution. The other 30 devices on the register offer less comprehensive app-based services using a smart phone or heavy mobile computer case without a permanent, in-cab device. EROAD’s major competitors offering in-cab hardware are yet to have ELD devices listed on the ELD register.

EROAD launched its ELD on Monday this week at ATA TMC, the American Trucking Associations’ Annual Meeting &amp; Transport Technology Exhibition in Nashville, TN. 

Trucking firms in the US have until December 2017 to comply with a federal regulation requiring drivers to record their record of duty status electronically in a way that is tamper-resistant and readily transferrable to enforcement officers. EROAD has also initiated independent, third-party verification to provide assurance to the industry that its system is compliant, best-in-class, and operationally easy to use.

“Having our ELD accepted onto the FMCSA register means we are able to offer a compliant ELD to the US market this month, as scheduled,” EROAD CEO, Steven Newman said.

EROAD’s ELD is offered on the same, integrated platform, as its electronic tax, safety and fleet management services, including electronic IFTA, Oregon Weight Mile Tax, driver and vehicle analytics, and real-time fleet tracking.

About EROAD
EROAD modernises road charging and compliance for road transport by replacing paper-based systems with easy-to-use electronic systems. The company is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand, and listed on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). Its US business is based in Portland, Oregon, serving customers with vehicles operating in every US mainland state, growing outward in concentration from the Northwest. In 2009 EROAD introduced the world’s first nationwide electronic road user charging (eRUC) system in New Zealand and, in 2017, more than 50% of heavy transport RUC is expected to be collected electronically, representing a rapid transition to e-commerce on a voluntary, industry-led basis, due to the cost-savings and benefits to customers. EROAD is also a leading provider of health and safety compliance services, including vehicle management and driver behaviour and performance measures.

    EVO - Application for waiver from Rule 8.1.7
    3:51pm, 16 Dec 2016 | WAV/RULE
  

  NZX Regulation Decision

Evolve Education Group Limited (EVO)

Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule
8.1.7

9 December 2016

Waiver from Main Board Listing Rule 8.1.7

Decision

1. Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by EVO is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (“NZXR”) grants EVO a waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule (“Rule”) 8.1.7 so that the Plan can confer the right to a change in the number of underlying Securities.

2. The waiver in paragraph 1 is provided on the conditions that:

a. the Plan is submitted to NZXR for approval under Rules 6.1.1 and 6.1.2(e); and

b. if it is necessary to make an adjustment to the number of underlying Securities of the Share Rights then:

i. EVO will provide NZXR with at least 10 Business Days’ notice prior to the adjustment that sets out:

1. a description of the circumstances giving rise to the adjustment;

2. the proposed adjustment to the Share Rights; and

3. a copy of the advice from the independent party that the adjustment is fair and reasonable to EVO and its shareholders;
ii. the directors of EVO certify to NZXR that:

1. they are satisfied with the advice from the independent party; and

2. in their opinion, the proposed amendment to the Share Rights is fair and reasonable to EVO and its shareholders.

3. The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision.This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.

4. The Rules to which this decision relates are set out in Appendix Two to this decision.

5. Capitalised terms which have not been defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.

Reasons

6. In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:

a. Rule 8.1.7 provides that an Option must not confer the right to change the exercise price or number of underlying Securities, unless such a change is made in accordance
with the exceptions to that Rule, including certain provisions allowing an amendment to the number of underlying securities in relation to a Rights issue. The policy objective of
Rule 8.1.7 is to ensure that Options may not be subsequently amended by the Issuer in a manner that is detrimental to the interests of the holders of other Equity Securities.
The exceptions relating to Rights issues are to ensure that the terms of options are adjusted so that on the occurrence of Rights issues the relative rights and benefits of shareholders and Share Rights holders are maintained.

b. Because there is no exercise price payable, Rule 8.1.7 is not well suited as a means of adjustment to Share Rights issued under the Plan. However the Plan provides for the
exercise of a discretion by the Board designed to have a similar effect to the requirements of Rule 8.1.7 should any adjustments to the terms of the Share Rights change the number of underlying Securities.

c. This waiver enables the terms of the Plan to permit the Board of EVO to make appropriate (discretionary) adjustments or alterations to the terms of the Share Rights as in the reasonable opinion of the Board are appropriate to ensure that, so far as is reasonably possible, Eligible Employees who participate in the Plan are not advantaged or disadvantaged as a result of the occurrence of certain circumstances
which have an effect on a Share Right.

d. No adjustment or alteration may be made to a Share Right if it would cause a breach of the Rules.

e. The granting of this waiver will not have any material adverse effect on EVO’s shareholders as the purpose and effect of the waiver is consistent with the purpose and
effect of Rule 8.1.7, which is to ensure that changes in Share Rights do not prejudice shareholders.

f. A purpose of the Plan is to add value to EVO and its shareholders through motivating Eligible Employees.

Confidentiality

7. EVO has requested that this waiver application and any decision be kept confidential until the Plan is announced by EVO.

8. In accordance with footnote 1 to Rule 1.11.2 NZXR grants EVOs request.

Appendix One

1. Evolve Education Group Limited (“EVO”) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares quoted on the NZX Main Board. EVO intends to introduce the ‘Evolve Education Group Performance
Share Rights Plan’ (the “Plan”) for the issue of performance share rights (“Share Rights”) to selected employees of EVO (“Eligible Employees”).

2. Under the terms of the Plan, Eligible Employees will be granted Share Rights which, if exercised, will convert on a one for one basis into fully paid ordinary shares in EVO. The
Share Rights are therefore Options as defined in Rule 1.6.1.

3. The Share Rights and the shares issued on the exercise of those Share Rights will be issued for no consideration.

4. Whether or not Share Rights issued under the Plan become exercisable, and the number of Share Rights that may become exercisable, depends on EVO meeting certain specified
performance hurdles. The performance hurdles for the Share Rights relate to the gross total shareholder return (“TSR”) achieved by EVO over the Performance Period, relative to
the S&amp;P/NZX 50 Index (the “Index”).

5. The TSR of EVO will be calculated and compared against the median TSR of the Index over the Performance Period.

6. EVO must, at the completion of the relevant performance period, determine whether the TSR hurdles have been achieved upon the advice of an independent expert.

7. Share Rights that are able to be exercised, may be exercised during the 20 business days from the date that the Eligible Employee is notified that the Share Rights have become exercisable following the end of the relevant performance period. Any Share Right that is not exercisable will lapse.

8. The Plan provides that the Board may make such adjustments or alterations to the terms of Share Rights as in the reasonable opinion of the Board are appropriate to ensure that
so far as is reasonably possible, Participants are not advantaged or disadvantaged as a
result of the occurrence of certain events that would affect the Share Rights. 

Appendix Two

8.1.7 An Option must not confer the right to a change in the exercise price or number of underlying Securities, except if that Option:

(a) was issued with the approval of holders of Quoted Equity Securities, then the exercise price or number of underlying Securities may change in accordance with the formula or provision contained in the terms of the Option if there is a Rights issue to the holders of the underlying Securities; or

(b) was not issued with the approval of holders of Quoted Securities and there is a Rights issue to the holders of the underlying Securities, then the exercise price of that
Option may be reduced according to the formula set out as follows:

    Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price Determined
    2:30pm, 30 Mar 2017 | DRP
  

  Auckland, 30 March 2017 – The share price used to calculate entitlements under the Fletcher Building Limited Dividend Reinvestment Plan has been set at NZ$7.9888. 
 
This is the average of the individual daily volume weighted average sale prices of all price-setting trades of Fletcher Building shares sold on the NZSX on each of the five business days from and including the ex-dividend date of 23 March 2017 pursuant to the terms of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Offer Document.   
 
Shareholders who have elected to participate in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan reinvest their dividends to receive additional shares, rather than cash.  The new shares will be allocated on the dividend date, 12 April 2017.  The number of Fletcher Building shares to which participants are entitled is the total of the net dividend remittance which would otherwise have been payable to participants, divided by 7.9888.   
 
Australian residents are paid in Australian dollars which have been converted using an exchange rate of NZ$1.00 = A$0.9175. 
 
An illustration of the calculation of the net dividend remittance is available on the Company's website (www.fbu.com/investor-centre/dividend-information/).

    EROAD suspends employee charged by FMA
    9:13am,  9 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Technology services provider EROAD has suspended an employee against whom the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has filed charges relating to insider trading. The employee is not a member of the senior executive team.

The FMA has filed charges alleging breaches of the insider trading prohibitions contained in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 by one current and one former EROAD employee. 
 
EROAD Chairman Mr Bushby noted that the FMA action is directed at two individuals, and that EROAD’s conduct is not the subject of investigation. EROAD supports and endorses the FMA’s commitment to the integrity of the capital markets in New Zealand, and has fully co-operated with and assisted the FMA throughout its investigation against the individuals. The matter relates to events in 2015.

EROAD is also considering bringing civil claims against both individuals for breach of confidence. 

Mr Bushby said the suspension and possibility of civil claims were part of a response to what appeared to be a serious breach of confidentiality, terms of employment, and the company’s code of ethics.

 “Irrespective of the FMA action, we are taking appropriate disciplinary action regarding the alleged sharing of confidential financial information for personal share trading,” he said. “We accord the security of our company information the highest priority.”

Mr Bushby said that the company had been disappointed to learn about the alleged actions of two individuals that led to the FMA’s proceedings.  “As a listed company we take our responsibilities very seriously and ensure that all our team has training and information to understand their obligations, the importance and consequences of insider trading laws and our own responsibilities.

 “We regard our values, ethics and integrity as a company as critically important and we strive to maintain the highest standards,” said Mr Bushby. 

He said that in reviewing the substantial amount of information that the company had provided the FMA to assist it in its investigation against the individuals, EROAD was confident that no data about staff, suppliers, customers or stakeholders had been compromised.

 “The information relating to this matter concerns EROAD historic financial information allegedly used for personal share trading,” he said. 

“While this is nonetheless a serious matter, we can assure our stakeholders that we remain vigilant with respect to protecting the integrity of our customer-facing systems and all third party data.”

He said that the company would be making no comment on the FMA’s proceedings, which were matters before the courts. Questions on this matter should be addressed to the FMA.

Summary
• EROAD supports and endorses the FMA’s commitment to the integrity of the capital markets in New Zealand, and EROAD has fully co-operated with and assisted the FMA throughout its investigation against the individuals.
• Staff training and information on the disclosure of confidential information and share trading is provided recurrently.  Adherence to strict confidentiality requirements is a condition of employment at EROAD.
• The FMA announcement relates to actions taken by two individuals in September 2015, and EROAD’s conduct is not the subject of investigation.  The FMA alleges that the former employee traded 15,000 EROAD shares in this period.

A copy of the FMA media announcement is available at https://fma.govt.nz/news/media-releases/.

    Improving health and safety behind technology uptake
    11:18am,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Two of New Zealand’s leading companies are installing new, sophisticated in-vehicle technology in their transport fleets to further improve their management of health and safety.

Transport technology service provider EROAD will provide Kiwi companies Fulton Hogan and Waste Management NZ Limited with more than 4,500 EROAD in-vehicle units as the companies look to further improve their health and safety management.
  
“The EROAD system has delivered many benefits for Fulton Hogan from reducing our Road User Charges to monitoring truck idling times to reduce fuel costs,” said Fulton Hogan’s Mechanical Engineer Graham Eaton.
  
“EROAD’s addition of driver behaviour features to help improve driver safety made the decision to install EROAD’s technology in more of our fleet very easy.  As a business with more than 6,700 people on our team, it’s important we stay safe at all times,” he said.

“One of our key Health and Safety policies is to, ‘Set objectives and targets to manage, measure and improve our performance’. EROAD makes this measurement and management simple by interfacing with our existing systems,” said Mr Eaton.

Waste Management’s decision to install EROAD technology has also been motivated by the ability to use Health and Safety services, said Waste Management’s National Fleet Manager, Jitesh Singh.
    
“EROAD delivers a range of capabilities to improve driver safety from the electronic logbook, including providing accurate information regarding driver rest periods and the pre-start inspection programme, which helps our drivers identify vehicle faults before they become a problem,” said Mr Singh.

“The safety of our people, our customers and our communities is paramount to us and we continue to invest in technology like EROAD to improve safety outcomes,” he said.

EROAD CEO Steven Newman said developing a suite of health and safety services had been a feature of the company’s recent R&amp;D investment, including features such as driver behaviour and driver logbook as well as vehicle-focused services like the EROAD Inspect app.

Mr Newman said the market response to EROAD’s in-vehicle device Ehubo2, which enables customers to access its full suite of health and safety services, had been very positive. Around 4,300 units were now used by fleets throughout the company’s Established market of New Zealand and Australia, since the product’s launch a year ago. 

In particular, being able to use EROAD’s data from a large population of drivers and vehicles enabled customers to benchmark against industry ‘norms’ and to reward good driving to improve performance. 

“Our customers tell us that benefits to health and safety management are a strong motivator to use our services, alongside economic benefits, like lower maintenance costs and improved fuel economy.”

    Preliminary Results Announcement for the first half of FY17

  1 March 2017

Market Release, Auckland, New Zealand

Finzsoft Limited (NZX:FIN) Reports Preliminary Interim Financial Results for Half Year Ended 31 December 2016

Finzsoft is pleased to provide its half-year report for the 6 month period ended 31 December 2016 and announces its performance highlights for the half year ended 31 December 2016:

- Six month operating revenue of $10.38 million, which is consistent with the same six month period in the previous year (FY16 $10.37 million).

- Strong customer base supporting underlying, recurring, licence and services revenue.

- EBITDA result of $3.3 million driven by timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

- Continued profitability, no debt and positive cash flow.

- Net profit after tax has increased to $1.9 million, up from $208,000 for the same period last year (6 month period ended 31 December 2015), again largely due to timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

    Results Announcement for the first half of FY17

  31 March 2017

Market Release, Auckland, New Zealand

Finzsoft Solutions Limited (NZX:FIN) Reports Interim Financial Results for Half Year Ended 31 December 2016

CONTINUED STRONG MOMENTUM LEVERAGING LOCAL OPPORTUNITIES

Finzsoft is pleased to provide its half-year report for the 6 month period ended 31 December 2016 and announces its performance highlights for the half year ended 31 December 2016:

• Six month operating revenue of $10.38 million, which is consistent with the same six month period in the previous year (FY16 $10.37 million).

•    Strong customer base supporting underlying licence and services revenue.

• EBITDA result of $3.3 million driven by timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

•    Continued profitability, no debt and positive cash flow.

• Net profit after tax has increased to $1.9 million, up from $208,000 for the same period last year (6 month period ended 31 December 2015), again largely due to timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

• Continued investment in sales and marketing to leverage and convert the opportunities in Asean brought about by the Silverlake investment.

Finzsoft is pleased to report its half-yearly earnings to 31 December 2016, continuing the company’s strong performance with continued investment in the company to set it up for long term sustainable growth in New Zealand, Australia and the wider Asean region.

Finzsoft Managing Director, Andrew Holliday said the continued expansion into the credit union market is exciting and builds on Finzsoft’s strong history of working with New Zealand’s credit unions and building societies. The proven track record of Finzsoft’s core banking software, Sovereign, which will run First Credit Union’s operations from customer service in the front end to all of the bank end operations, was critical to Finzsoft being chosen as the new partner for First Credit Union and Westforce Credit Union.

Based on current contracted revenue, along with our pipeline opportunities for our financial year ending 30 June 2017, we will expect to see Finzsoft continuing to operate profitably with no debt and positive cash flow. We have ongoing delivery to our key client work orders both in Australia and New Zealand”.

    Comvita Announces Half Year Results
    9:54am, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  For the six month period ending 31 December 2016, Comvita (NZX:CVT) today announced a net loss after tax of $7.1m on sales of $57.7m.  This result is in line with earlier guidance, and compares with a reported net profit after tax (NPAT) of $3.0m on sales of $91.1m for the six month period to 30 September 2015. The interim results for both periods are unaudited. 

At an operating level, adjusting for changes in fair value of derivatives, the net loss after tax was $4.4m.  The difference between the reported NPAT and the operating NPAT is the revaluation of Comvita’s options in SeaDragon (NZX:SEA) down by $2.8m.

Financial results for the period six months to 31 December 2016 (six months to 30 September 2015)

Sales 2016 $57.7m, 2015 $91.1m
EBITDA* 2016 ($2.8m), 2015 $10.2m
EBITDA% 2016 (5.0%), 2015 11.0%
NPAT 2016 ($7.1m), 2015 $3.0m
Earnings per share (cents) 2016 (17.18), 2015 7.69
Dividends per share (cents) 2016 2.0, 2015 6.0
ROCE 2016 ( 3.0%), 2015 4.0%

* EBITDA: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
** ROCE: return on capital employed.

Comvita Chairman Neil Craig says, “As we signalled in our market update of 23 January, informal channel sales to China through Asian resellers in Australia and New Zealand are down on expectations and the 2016 comparative period.  The poor interim result is almost entirely a result of the drop in sales in these two markets.  While this result is very disappointing, we are very pleased with the mitigating actions taken by the management team, including cost reduction initiatives, with a focus on productivity and ongoing innovation and product development.  The changes made to the business this year will set us up well for further growth in earnings beyond the excellent 2016 result when the sales environment improves.  The board believes the company is still well placed to meet its long term strategic objectives.” 

Dividend 
“On 23 January 2017, we advised that we anticipated our 2017 after tax operating earnings would be in the range of $5-7m.  In keeping with our current dividend payment policy of 40-45% of annual after tax operating profits, we will pay a fully imputed interim dividend of two cents per share on 21 March 2017 for those shares registered 14 March 2017.” 

Derma Sciences, Inc. Post Half Year Event
Mr. Craig said, “We believe the Derma Science (Nasdaq:DSCI) transaction is an exceptional one for our shareholders.  We sold the Medihoney brand for NZ $19m, however we have retained the worldwide rights to use the brand in over the counter (OTC) channels.  We have also entered into a new manufacturing agreement that enables us to lower our costs for products in our range that require Medical Device certifications, and develop a Medihoney branded Manuka honey band-aid.  The agreement also provides for Comvita to supply bulk, medical grade Manuka honey on a commercial basis over the long term.  

US company Integra Life Sciences (Nasdaq:IART) has made an offer to buy Derma Sciences at US$7 per share which values our stake at approximately NZ$11m.  The total value of the Medihoney sale and the share sale is approximately NZ$30m immediately, with the prospect of a further US$5m over several years, provided certain Medihoney sales targets are met by Integra.” 

“With the share placement made to China Resources on 26 October 2016 of $21m and the recent Derma Sciences transaction, Comvita has a strong balance sheet.  As communicated already, these funds will be applied to debt reduction and then for funding strategic initiatives and potential acquisitions currently under consideration.”

CEO Commentary
Comvita CEO Scott Coulter said, “The business operating conditions in our two biggest markets (Australia and New Zealand) have been extremely tough over the first six months and account for most of the shortfall in revenue for the period.  We are working through a painful period of channel rebalancing from informal to more formal paths to China. This adjustment period may continue for a few more months and the informal channel business in Australasia remains the largest risk to our short term projections.  Longer term Comvita is well positioned to cement our competitive advantage through the strategic partnerships we have set up at both the supply end of its business and inside China itself.”

Our China Joint Venture is on track and expected to start from 1 July 2017.  This will improve both our profitability from China based sales and our visibility into this market. Our strategic partnership with China Resources is progressing well and we believe this relationship will enable our brand to expand more broadly into Chinese based distribution of high quality, premium, healthy food products outside our traditional bee-products base.

As we informed the market on 23 January 2017, the honey season is likely to be significantly impacted by prolonged and unfavourable weather conditions.  This was an exceptionally poor honey harvest across the country. Harvest risk is recognised as a characteristic of beekeeping and this is going to happen from time to time, although the extent this event impacted most of our Apiaries and subsequently our profitability in the second half ending 30 June, was highly unusual.

We will not have full visibility on our 2017 honey harvest until April/May 2017.  As the honey season progresses down the country from North to South, some hives are still in the field collecting honey, which means estimating the harvest is extremely difficult.  Since our last announcement, the honey season has progressed another month with little improvement in the weather conditions.  As we have mentioned previously, assuming a return to normal weather patterns next year, the operating profit impact of this poor honey harvest will be isolated to this current financial year.

Management have used the opportunity over the past six months to significantly improve our underlying operating business.  The company has reduced its operating cost base by $6.5m in the first half, and we expect full year savings of $10m compared to the prior year.  At the same time we have developed new capability in innovation, as we build towards achieving our strategic goals of value additions to our existing honey business and diversification of the product range.  We now have a dedicated innovation team within the business with a cross functional skill base including food formulating, topical products formulation, regulatory affairs, patent management, marketing and project management expertise. 

The Derma Sciences transaction enabled us to reduce debt substantially, from $82m at 31 December 2016 to $53m by 31 March 2017, an amount significantly lower than our total inventory position at $97m.

Innovation
It is important to note while we are vigorously pursuing a diversification strategy, we are not placing any less emphasis on our core bee products business, and in particular Manuka honey.  Our inventory is in a very strong position and we are opening new channels and markets for Manuka honey, as well as launching a number of new, value-added initiatives with products containing Manuka Honey.  We have launched a Manuka honey beverage range, a range of sugar free lozenges containing Manuka honey and will shortly launch therapeutic versions of pure Manuka honey lozenges. 

From Derma Sciences we expect to launch a range of Manuka honey wound dressing products by mid-2017.  The sale of the Medihoney brand to Derma Sciences still allows Comvita to have exclusive world-wide use of the Medihoney brand in the OTC market.  The Medihoney therapeutic skincare range, targeted at customers who have skin prone to Eczema, is growing strongly in Australian pharmacy channels, our largest Medihoney market at 37% on a moving annual total (MAT) basis.

Fresh Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) continues to go from strength to strength in Australia, our largest OLE market, and we have grown OLE sales in this market by 24% on an MAT basis, driven by new innovation in high strength capsules. Our focus over the next few months will be driving OLE sales and innovation in markets outside Australia. 

Markets
Japan is now one of our faster growing markets with sales increasing by 20% for the six months ended 31 December 2016. Sales to our distributor in China have impacted our Asian sales, hence the reported drop in sales over this period from $30m to $20m.  This change in sales is due to timing of shipments and seasonal differences in the reporting periods.  While sales have decreased over this period to Asia, the profit contribution made on these sales is virtually the same. This indicates a lift in profitability in our Asian business. 

Our sales data demonstrates Comvita’s underlying growth in China continues.  Over the last quarter of 2016, an important period for seasonal reasons, as this period includes the onset of winter as well as covering a number of important sales events like singles day, our China distributor sales grew at 15% compared with the same quarter in 2015.  There have been a number of marketing initiatives, including live steaming from our Paengaroa Head Office to 300,000 consumers on T-Mall, which will position our brand well for future growth.  It is also important to note that while our online business inside China continues to grow, we have a good base of offline retail locations to provide consumers with the ability to connect and engage directly with our brand.

Sales in the UK are up by 10.5% on a similar currency basis over the prior six month period.  We have several new listings in pharmacy with Boots and with Holland &amp; Barrett, the UK’s largest health food chain, which will help us drive second half growth.  The USA is growing strongly, particularly with e-commerce sales, and we expect to move into a profitable position in this market within the next 12 months.  We expect the UK, Korea and Japan to all grow this year on a same currency basis, although the Brexit impact on the UK currency will have a dampening effect in NZ dollar terms.

Overall, we expect our second half year sales to be up significantly on our first half year due to continued growth in the non-Chinese markets, improvement in Australasian sales, the effect of new sales initiatives in new and existing markets and an increasing contribution to sales from our innovation pipeline.

Executive Chairman’s Interim Report 2017

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Delegat Group Limited, I am pleased to present its operating and financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2016. 

Performance Highlights
- Record Global Case Sales of 1,446,000.
- Record Operating NPAT of $24.7 million.
- Capital investment of $21.9 million in growth assets including vineyard development and the Hawke's Bay and Marlborough Wineries.
- Oyster Bay received the 'Hot Brand' award from New York's highly regarded Impact Magazine for a seventh consecutive year.
- Barossa Valley Estate Shiraz 2014 and Grenache Shiraz Mourvedre 2014 were both awarded 90 Points by James Halliday, Australia’s leading wine writer. 
- Delegat Crownthorpe Terraces Chardonnay 2015 received a Gold Medal at the New Zealand International Wine Show 2016.

The Group presents its financial statements in accordance with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS).  The Directors continue to be of the view that the results reported under NZ IFRS do not provide adequate insight into the Group’s underlying operational performance, primarily due to a number of fair value adjustments that are required to be reported on.  To better understand the operating performance, the Group has published an Operating Performance report and reconciliation of Operating Profit to Reported Profit. This reconciliation eliminates from each line in the Statement of Financial Performance all fair value adjustments.   

Operating Performance
A record Operating NPAT of $24.7 million was generated compared to $21.1 million for the same period the previous year.  Operating EBIT of $41.4 million is $7.6 million higher than for the same period the previous year.  

Delegat achieved Operating Revenue of $135.8 million on global case sales of 1,446,000 in the six month period. Revenue is up $7.2 million on the same period last year due to a 14% increase in global case sales, partially offset by the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.

Operating Gross Margin is up 6% on the same period last year and is impacted by lower cost of goods per case arising from the higher yielding 2016 vintage.   Operating Expenses at $35.3 million are $2.9 million lower than the same period last year.  This is due to the impact of a stronger New Zealand currency on the translation of off-shore expenditure.

NZ IFRS Fair Value adjustments
In accordance with NZ IFRS the Group is required to account for certain of their assets at fair value rather than at historic cost.  All movements in these fair values are reflected in and impact the Statement of Financial Performance.  The Group records adjustments in respect of two significant items at the half-year reporting date: 
• Harvest Provision Release (Grapes) – Inventory is valued at market value, rather than costs incurred, at harvest.  Any fair value adjustment is excluded from Operating Performance for the year, by creating a Harvest Provision.  This Harvest Provision is then released through Cost of Sales when inventory is sold in subsequent years. The adjustment provides a write-down of $8.3 million (December 2015: $4.8 million);
• Derivative Instruments held to hedge the Group’s foreign currency and interest rate exposure. The mark-to-market movement of these instruments at balance date resulted in a fair value write-up of $0.6 million (December 2015: $5.4 million).
These together with minor adjustments in respect of share-based payments, net of taxation, amount to a write-down of $5.6 million (December 2015: write-up of $0.4 million).

 
Cash Flow
The Group generated Cash Flows from Operations of $24.9 million in the current half-year, which is an increase of $9.8 million on the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher receipts from customers due to the higher cases sales. A total of $23.0 million was invested in additional property, plant and equipment during the period, including vineyard development in New Zealand and the Barossa Valley, and development of the Hawke's Bay and Marlborough wineries, which will provide earnings growth into the years ahead. The Group distributed $12.1 million to shareholders in dividends. Additional borrowings of $10.3 million were drawn down to fund the increased capital investment during the six months.
The Group has Net Debt of $292.0 million, compared to $282.7 million at 30 June 2016 – an increase of 3% and well within the Group's long term bank debt facilities.

Looking Forward
The results achieved in the six months to December 2016 are testament to the strength of the Group's business model. Delegat Group is well positioned to pursue its strategic goal to build a leading global Super Premium wine company.. The Group is on target to achieve global case sales for the full year of 2,632,000, up 9% on last year.  The Group continues to face risks in the form of exchange rate volatility, which makes it difficult to forecast financial performance.  Based on the prevailing exchange rates, the Group forecasts a 2017 operating profit result in line with last year's record performance.

    Comvita Updates Previous Guidance 
    10:01am,  5 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  Comvita announced today that the two major downside risks communicated in our previous market announcements of 23 January and 21 February 2017 have both come to bear, and we now expect that the direct impact of these two situations will result in an after tax operating loss for the financial year ended 30 June 2017, in the order of $7m.  Reported net profit after tax is now expected to be approximately $9m after including the sale of Medihoney IP and shares in Derma Sciences, Inc.
 
Trading conditions over the last two months in its two largest markets (Australia and New Zealand) have not recovered in line with our earlier expectations.  For forecast purposes, in terms of this June year financial result, we are now assuming that the informal channels out of Australia and New Zealand into China will not recover to our earlier forecast levels before 30 June 2017.  To exacerbate the financial impact of this sales downturn, continued poor weather has further reduced the production of honey for the 2016-2017 season.  

Comvita CEO Scott Coulter, said, “Although the informal trade channels will show growth over the previous half year this is still well under our previous expectations, and much of these sales to China have been satisfied by inventory held within the various channels to market. Our distribution strategy, both online and offline continues to provide our consumers the ability to connect and engage directly with our brand. We believe that when the channel has been fully ‘de-stocked’ that we should see both ‘sell in’ and ‘sell through’ and as a consequence a return to much improved financial performance”.

“The commencement of operation of our China distribution Joint Venture on 1 July 2017 is an important stepping stone to getting closer to our customers in China, and to be able to have more influence over our brand. We measure our brand health regularly and our key metrics inside China of Awareness, Trial and Frequency of Use have improved over the previous period. Our navigation of the changing trading environment in mainland China continues to be a main focus to management as we look to enhance all channels to market”.

Comvita Chairman Neil Craig, said “With respect to our apiary business, it’s quite straight forward in beekeeping, you spend money with the objective of collecting honey. If there is no honey then you will still incur the costs.  It’s a core part of our planning to mitigate against regional weather events by having hives located in strategic locations around the country, said Mr Craig but we can’t mitigate against poor weather across the whole country.” Mr Craig stressed as per Comvita’s previous guidance that this harvest was seen as a one off, with some experts saying it was a 1 in 20 year event. Given the nature of the 2016-2017 honey harvest and the fact that Comvita has significant levels of inventory, the extremely poor season is unlikely to impact future profitability.   
 
“In summary, while the simultaneous impact of two very significant events in one financial year is ‘tough to stomach’, the Comvita business model remains sound.  We have focused on productivity and cost saving initiatives across the business and we have already implemented significant permanent overhead cost reductions.  At the same time, as part of our diversification strategy we will deliver significant new market, channel and product innovation initiatives this year which will underpin our sales increase in the second half year and sets us up well for FY18.  Given an average honey harvest in 2017-2018, we remain on track to deliver our medium and longer term strategic objectives beyond what has been a very challenging period of time for the company.”  

Ends.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Half Year Results to 31 Dec 2016 and Interim Dividend
    8:30am,  8 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  FLIWAY GROUP LIMITED

Financial Results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 (Unaudited)

OVERVIEW - BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS

Stronger performance from the Business Development teams in both the Domestic and International divisions meant revenue for 1H17 was down year on year by only 1.4% despite the customer loss announced in June 2016. The December month's revenue was 5% ahead of last year as the new customer wins and existing customer uptrades delivered a strong revenue finish to the first half of FY17. Further customer contract  wins with commencement dates in 2017 have seen us secure additional capacity in both Transport and Warehousing.

Fliway Group performance was impacted by the customer loss. As indicated at the time, it was expected the EBITDA impact could appropximate 10% of Fliway's historical EBITDA performance and this has been reflected in the 1H17 results. Issues additionally impacting the business have been capacity constraints in the Transport business unit as a result of internal linehaul equipment availablility and the Kaikoura earthquake, which transferred significant rail freight volumes onto road, thereby consuming capacity overflow options over a peak trading period. Customer volumes, particularly in the second quarter, exceeded the network capacity in Transport.

Additional work was gained through the wider relationship with UPS and a number of initiatives were undertaken in the UPS-Fliway joint venture to lower the cost of package delivery in New Zealand, in order to create a more competitive international destination offering and facilitate higher levels of import package growth moving forward.

DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE

Domestic Division
Transport volume levels for the six months to December were ahead of last year as a result of the excellent business development work in that division that has seen new accounts either trading or signed, approximating $5 million in annualised new revenue. The higher freight volumes in the Transport business unit have seen Fliway operating outside its network capacity, requiring short term supplementary capacity solutions that have come at a cost premium due largely to that capacity being consumed by the consequences of the Kaikoura earthquake which significantly increased the road freight task as rail freight was disabled.

Internally, the Transport business unit implemented cost initiatives as a result of anticipated lower volumes that reduced capacity, at a time when new business and customer uptrades saw volumes increase ahead of last years levels. This short term capacity shortfall created cost issues that will have more economic solutions implemented against them in the future.

In the Logistics business unit, warehousing revenues were slightly down on last year, with strong cost management delivering a comparable profit result to last year. As a result of the business development wins in the domestic division, Fliway will be increasing warehouse capacity in Auckland by a further 6,000 square metres, or approx. 20%, in quarter 3 to accommodate the new growth. 

The roll out of the new Warehouse Management System is progressing well and will deliver productivity gains once  fully implemented.

International Division
EBITDA for the division was in line with last year, as a result of strong customer focus and good results from the business development team in winning new customers. The first half of FY17 saw significant changes in Flway International, with management changes, a continuation of low sea freight rates and some customer churn. The management team of the division has been re-organised and is performing well under the new leadership, strengthening relationships with network partners, customers and carriers.

As part of the customer focus initiatives in International, progress is being made on creating improved technological solutions to deliver for customers improved data and visibilty whilst at the same time moving to a paperless environment with improved workflow.

UPS-Fliway Joint Venture
In 1H17 import packages handled by the joint venture grew on the prior year by 13% and with a more competitive import cost, the expectation is to further grow these import volumes to produce higher financial returns in the future. The contribution from the UPS-Fliway joint venture was down on last year, with NPAT down by $0.155 million, as a result of a strategy designed to improve the cost of delivering a package in New Zealand in order to drive continued import package growth. 

GROUP CASHFLOWS AND DEBT

Operating cashflows were $1.1 million compared to the prior year's half figure of $3.0 million, as a result of the lower earnings and an increase in working capital levels by $1.2 million.  The higher revenues in December 2016 pushed debtor levels and with lower payables saw net working capital lift on the prior year, with the intention to manage this position back to historical levels, subject to continued revenue growth.

Net capital expenditure for the half year was $1.6 million, with $1.3 million of that spend relating to truck expenditure as Fliway returns to a more normal vehicle replacement cycle. The prior year FY16 truck spend was suppressed due to the significant fleet refresh in FY15 ahead of the NZX listing.

Fliway debt levels at 31 December 2016 were $8.8 million as compared to a bank facility of $18 million and represent 
1.5 times EBITDA, ensuring the balance sheet gearing still allows room for growth.

DIVIDEND

Consistent with prospectus and historical guidance with respect to the percentage of NPAT payable and the weighting between the first half and second half earnings, Fliway's Directors have approved the payment of an interim ordinary dividend of 2.0 cents per share. The dividends are payable on 20 April 2017 to shareholders recorded on the share register as at 5:00pm (New Zealand time) on 31 March 2017.

OUTLOOK

The first half reflects a perid of change in the business and a re-positioning for future growth. Transport capacity, margins and cost management remain priorities for the Group in order to convert the significant new customer wins in 1H17 into improved profitability in 2H17.

The balance sheet and declared dividend remain conservative to ensure capacity exists in whatever form required to convert the strong sales pipeline into improved future earnings.

Sales growth remains a focus for the Group as Fliway looks to sell to capacity in it's network and increase relationships with existing customers and business partners. 1H17 volumes finished the year strongly and with significant new customer wins still to come on board, it is our expectation that current momentum will be continued, giving us confidence that 2H17 will deliver improved results over the prior year.

    IQE  Intueri 2016 Annual Report and s 209 notice
    8:55am, 24 Mar 2017 | ANNREP
  

  NZX RELEASE

24 March 2017

IQE – INTUERI 2016 ANNUAL REPORT AND S 209 NOTICE

Listed vocational education provider Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) has today released its Annual Report for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016. The Annual Report is available for viewing on the company website www.intueri.co.nz. 

Changes to Preliminary Results Announcement
Due to the change in timing of the closure of the Australian colleges, which has now been brought forward to 29 March 2017, the recoverability and value of assets held in Australia has been reassessed since the release of the preliminary financial statements. This has resulted in further costs of $0.95m associated with an impairment charge of $0.15m, a $0.7m reduction in current assets no longer considered recoverable, and an additional $0.1m in liabilities associated with closure costs. The net loss after tax has increased to $24.3m from $23.3m.

Going Concern Basis
After careful consideration, Intueri’s Directors formed the judgement that it was appropriate to prepare the 2016 financial statements on a going concern basis. 

The Directors acknowledge however that alternative interpretations are possible, that Intueri’s financial position and prospects remain subject to change, and that material uncertainties remain which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, relating primarily to the outcome of the capital restructure, the Group’s ability to pay debts, ongoing bank support, the achievement of enrolment numbers and cost savings, and the resolution of the outstanding Tertiary Education Commission investigation into Quantum Education group. 

Further information is outlined in Note 2 of the financial statements included in the 2016 Annual Report. 

Audit Opinion
The independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has not been able to form an opinion on these Financial Statements due to the significant uncertainties and insufficient audit evidence to satisfy, within their materiality limits, the carrying value of non-current assets in the Statement of Financial Position, and whether the application of the going concern assumption is appropriate.

There is no certainty that a bid will materialise or an acquisition be completed as a result of the current strategic review, and Intueri recommends that persons considering trading in Intueri shares seek professional advice prior to doing so.

    IQE SFO Enquiry into Quantum Closed
    10:08am, 12 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  IQE – SFO ENQUIRY INTO QUANTUM CLOSED 

Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) has been advised that the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has decided to close their enquiry into Quantum Education Group, with no further action required.

This enquiry, which focused on historical enrolment matters at Quantum, followed an initial request for information in January 2016. Intueri received no further requests or notifications from the SFO following the request for information.

The only outstanding regulatory matter for Intueri is the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) investigation into Quantum. Intueri is scheduled to provide a response to the draft investigation report by 12 May 2017.

Chris Kelly, Intueri Chair says “Intueri is very pleased that the SFO enquiry has been closed. We are focused on providing a response to the draft TEC report, and look forward to a conclusion of that investigation shortly. We are continuing to focus on delivery of quality vocational learning opportunities for both domestic and international students in New Zealand through our three PTE groups.”

    IQE – Intueri to Exit Australia Early; Focus on NZ Schools
    8:30am, 24 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE

23 March 2017

IQE – INTUERI TO EXIT AUSTRALIA EARLY; FOCUS ON NEW ZEALAND SCHOOLS

• Intueri will cease operations in Australia on 29 March 2017. This has no impact on the Group’s New Zealand operations.
• The decision is in response to recent funding and regulatory developments which have had a material impact on the Australian operations, including the deregistration of two of Intueri’s Australian schools and notification that the 2016 request for an uplift in the VFH funding cap of $5.6m has been declined. 
• The Intueri Board is considering whether to appeal against the decision on the 2016 VFH funding cap uplift; and is continuing to seek VFH payments for 2014/2015 of A$0.14m and for 2017 of approximately A$0.5m for teach out of students undertaken to date. 
• Intueri has entered into a Standstill Agreement with its bank.

Listed vocational education provider, Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE), advises that it will cease operations in Australia on 29 March 2017. This decision has no impact on the Group’s New Zealand operations, which are run as a separate regional division and have confirmed funding in place. 

The decision by Intueri’s Board to close the Australian operations is in response to a number of recent developments including notification from the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) that it intends to cancel the registration of Intueri’s Australian colleges, Conwal &amp; Associates Pty Ltd and Online Courses Australia Pty Ltd. Intueri had planned to voluntarily deregister both colleges at the end of 2017, allowing it to teach out existing students or, where necessary, assist in the transfer of some students to other teaching institutions to finish their courses. This would have seen Intueri’s Australian colleges operate in a breakeven position for the rest of the year. The company has elected not to appeal ASQA’s decision, and will therefore cease the Australian operations on 29 March 2017. 

Intueri has also been advised that its application to the Department of Education and Training (DET) to reconsider a A$5.6m uplift in 2016 VET FEE-HELP (VFH) funding has been declined. The Board is considering whether to appeal this decision. In addition, Intueri has been advised that payment of any Q1 2017 VFH funding by the DET will be deferred until 1 April 2017 at the earliest.

Intueri is still seeking A$0.14m in outstanding VFH funding for 2014/2015, and will seek approximately A$0.5m in VFH funding for students taught in the 2017 calendar year to date. 

Intueri is very disappointed with this outcome, given that Intueri had a managed exit strategy in place which it believes would have been in the best interests of students and staff.  It is working closely with the industry body, ACPET, to assist in the transfer of students to alternative providers, and providing support to staff. 

The decision to exit Australia has no impact on Intueri’s New Zealand operations. Confirmed funding is in place for 2017 and management continue to focus on ensuring the ongoing provision of high quality vocational education from its New Zealand schools. 

As previously advised, the Board is assessing a number of capital restructuring and strategic options for the Group, including a potential divestment of businesses. Intueri has entered into a standstill agreement with its bank for the duration of the review. 

Intueri also advises that it has received the draft Deloitte report from the TEC’s investigation into Quantum. Intueri is currently reviewing the report and will provide a response by 20 April 2017 as requested.

    IQE- Grant Thornton Appointed to Wind Up Australian Subs
    8:30am,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE

6 April 2017

IQE – GRANT THORNTON APPOINTED TO WIND UP AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARIES

Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) today announces that Grant Thornton partners Andrew Hewitt and Shaun McKinnon have been appointed as liquidators to all of Intueri’s Australian subsidiaries, following the cessation of operations in Australia in March 2017. 

The decision by Intueri’s Board to close the Australian operations was in response to a number of recent developments, which have already been announced. The lack of VET FEE-HELP (VFH) funding from the Department of Education and Training, along with regulatory changes in Australia, have been determining factors. Intueri’s Australian subsidiaries have not received any VFH payments in 2017 for students taught up to the cessation of operations, and due to the Group’s current position, Intueri is unable to continue to provide financial support to maintain its Australian subsidiaries.

Intueri continues to focus on its New Zealand businesses and the current strategic review, and the liquidation is not expected to have any impact on the New Zealand operations of the Intueri Group.

Chair of Intueri, Chris Kelly, commented; “The Board has been investigating a number of potential options for the Australian business, including the possible sale of assets and brand names. Disappointingly none of these other avenues have been able to be realised.”

    ikeGPS Announces Co-Marketing and Integration With SAi 
    8:30am,  3 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  For Immediate Release          April 3, 2017 

ikeGPS Announces Co-Marketing and Integration With SAi 
Ð Spike integrated into design software used by more than 100,000 sign customers –

BROOMFIELD, Colo.—ikeGPS announces a new co-marketing and software integration deal with SA International and its Flexi software, the sign design software used by more the 100,000 end users. This integration allows Spike to offer a more full solution to customers with respect to sign design and further its presence in the sign and digital graphics industry. 

With customers in over 50 countries, SAi is a leader in offering software solutions from design to production for the sign making, digital printing, screen printing and CNC machining industries. SAi also boasts a large network of resellers, and Flexi offered in more than 13 languages. 

“We are excited to partner with such a respected player in the sign and digital graphics industry as we work toward making Spike a fuller solution that specifically addresses the needs of the sign market,” says Glenn Milnes, CEO of ikeGPS. “Our integration with SAi’s Flexi is a positive step in expanding Spike’s reach within the market.” 

The new integration allows Flexi users to export a scaled image from the Spike Cloud and import it directly into Flexi design software. The 1-to-1 scaled image removes several steps from the design process, enabling sign shops to much more quickly turnaround work estimates with design renderings. 

Spike allows sign and digital graphics professionals to quickly and safely capture measurements for estimates of signage locations from a smartphone or tablet picture and the Spike device. A ladder, bucket truck and tape measure are no longer required to conduct site surveys and create estimates and designs, saving sign companies time and overhead costs on a traditionally lengthy process.

The measurements of the sign or graphic location are saved with the Spike photo and can be shared with customers, designers or production team to create job estimates and design proofs, assess installation and complete permit applications. If additional measurements are needed, users can refer to their saved Spike photos at any time to make modifications using the Spike mobile app or Spike Cloud. There’s no need to return to the site for further measurements or estimates. 

ikeGPS and SAi will announce the new integration to the sign and digital grpahics industry at the International Sign Association Sign Expo in Las Vegas April 20-22, where Spike was last year given the 2016 Innovation Award for the industry. For more information on how Spike is changing the way measurements and assets are captured and managed, visit www.ikegps.com/spike/.

    IKE Update
    9:01am,  5 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  For Immediate Release       5 April 2017

 IKE Update 

IKE advises the following:
- Stanley Smart Measure Pro units shipped into the European construction market ended at 30,500 units for the year, above original guidance but below the latest projected volumes of 39,500 units.  The additional 9,000 units, ordered for March 2017 delivery, will now ship 1H FY18.
- Stanley Black &amp; Decker made the decision to defer acceptance of these 9,000 units.  For IKE this had an impact on cash-received in the quarter of greater than $1m.  This was expected to contribute to projected cash positive operation for the quarter, which was not achieved. 
- Positively, IKE4 orders from the electric utility and communications market strengthened again in Q4 FY18. 
IKE CEO, Glenn Milnes, commented, “An unfortunate item to end what was an otherwise positive period for the business was Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s decision to defer their acceptance of 9,000 units that were ordered for March delivery.  We do not believe this impacts the longer-term potential for sales of the Stanley Smart Measure Pro product, which have grown strongly this year, but clearly this was a disappointment for us from a period end and reporting perspective.”  

“More positively, IKE4 sales, the biggest contributor to IKE’s revenue and margin, ended the fourth quarter well.  Our cash position at year end was approximately $2.8m and we are taking positive overall sales momentum into FY18 with the addition of the above orders that will now ship from April.”

    Infratil Investor Day 2017
    8:39am, 29 Mar 2017 | ADDRESS
  

  Infratil has released the presentation material for its annual Investor Day attended by major shareholders, fund managers, broker analysts, regulatory agencies, business partners and commentators.

Infratil has a clear strategy for providing good risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders over the long-term. It invests in sectors with powerful growth characteristics where there are opportunities for expertise and excellent management to create shareholder value.

Air travel, decarbonisation of energy and transport, accommodation and care for the elderly, electronic data storage, urban mobility, student accommodation, and residential utilities; are all themes underlying Infratil investments. 

The presentations highlight the focus on deploying capital in the newly established platforms of renewables, eldercare and data infrastructure, alongside ongoing performance improvements in Infratil’s core assets. Key presentations this year from Infratil’s newer businesses; Longroad, Tilt, RetireAustralia and Canberra Data Centres; show how they are taking advantage of their sector’s growth to create value. Also covered is how generation-retailing in the New Zealand electricity market can deliver satisfactory returns given low demand growth and regulatory interventions.

Each business will discuss its growth initiatives and areas of high confidence and relative uncertainty. The management approach is illustrated by Longroad and Tilt. On the one hand both the USA and Australia will continue to decarbonise their energy sectors with efficient renewable capacity, on the other hand political and regulatory noise has reduced near-term transparency. Longroad and Tilt’s response is logical and prudent; create options.  

Canberra Data Centres was Infratil's largest ever new investment, reflecting management’s high conviction of the sector and CDC's positioning. Even since Infratil agreed to acquire its 48% shareholding, the sector’s evolution seems to have accelerated. CDC offers its clients a unique ecosystem and a differentiated package of data security, accessibility and reliability. 

Infratil remains committed to its goal of increasing its dividends, which remains on track given the outlook for the year ended 31 March 2017.

Preliminary guidance has also been provided for the 2018 financial year.

The 2018 guidance assumes EBITDAF contribution from existing businesses, which may change over the year if further divestments or investments occur. Cash flow, interest and non-cash costs are also predicated on the same status quo assumption.

    Results For The 6 Month Period Ended 1 February 2017
    8:49am, 30 Mar 2017 | HALFYR
  

  30th March 2017
Hallenstein Glasson Holdings Limited
Results for the 6 months ended 1st February 2017
The company advises that total group sales for the 6 month period ended 1 February 2017 were $122.9million, an increase of 9.4% over the prior corresponding period ($112.4million). Net Profit after Tax (unaudited) was $9.185m, an increase of 34.7% on the prior corresponding period ($6.817m). The result is in line with guidance announced to the NZX on 3 February 2017.
Gross margin on sales was 58.1% compared to 56.8% in the prior corresponding period. This has been achieved due to an improved exchange rate and better product cost prices achieved through negotiation. Expenses continue to be well controlled and are in line with expectation.  While Glassons saw strong sales growth in both countries, Hallenstein Brothers and Storm saw a small decline in sales on the prior corresponding period. There is continued management focus on both brands and results for the start of the winter season have already seen improvement. Ecommerce growth for the group continued with sales increasing by 35% on the prior corresponding period.  
Glassons Australia continued further expansion with the opening of a further 2 new stores, refurbishing 3 stores, and closing 2 non profitable stores in the season. This helped drive an increase in sales of 23.3% on the prior corresponding period, and saw the Australian chain return to profit. Hallenstein Brothers opened 2 stores in Queensland, Australia during the season with early results in line with expectation. 
Dividend
The balance sheet continues to be robust and stock levels remain controlled. The directors have recommended an interim dividend of 14.5 cents per share (last year 13.5 cents per share), payable on 13th April 2017. The dividend will be fully imputed.
Future Outlook 
Total Group sales for the first 7 weeks of the 2017 winter season have been encouraging, increasing on last year by 5%. Gross margin continues to show a small improvement over last year. Growth in sales from ecommerce continues to out-perform bricks and mortar, with sales for the first 7 weeks of the season up 36%. Each chain is in a strong position going into the key winter trading months. Mark Goddard will commence as Group CEO mid-April.

    HBL: Waiver from various NZX Main Board Listing Rules 
    2:47pm, 31 Mar 2017 | WAV/RULE
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
Heartland Bank Limited (“HBL”)
Application for a waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rules 7.3.1, 7.5.1, 7.12.2, 9.1.1 and 9.2.1

13 February 2017

Background
1. The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
2. The Rules to which this decision relates are set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
3. Capitalised terms that are not defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.
Application 1 – Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.12.2 in respect of announcement of conversion
Decision
4. Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 5 below, and on the basis that the information provided by HBL is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZXR grants HBL a waiver from Rule 7.12.2 so that, if Conversion of the Heartland Notes occurs on account of a non-viability trigger event, HBL is not required to give notice for the purposes of Rule 7.12.2 in relation to the Conversion at least ten Business Days before the Conversion occurs.
5. The waiver in paragraph 4 above is provided on the conditions that:
a. the notice required by Rule 7.12.2 must be given as soon as practicable and in any event before the NZX Main Board opens for trading on the Business Day after the Conversion occurs;
b. the full terms and conditions of the Heartland Notes are released to NZX on the issue date of the Heartland Notes together with disclosure that Conversion will occur without prior notice to the market and will have a dilutionary impact for existing holders of HBL Shares;
c. the information required by Rule 7.12.2 which is known at the date of the Information Memorandum is disclosed in the Information Memorandum; and
d. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in the Information Memorandum.
Reasons
6. In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 4 above, NZXR has considered that:
a. HBL has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that if a Conversion is required, HBL will be unable to provide 10 Business Days’ prior notice, as required by Rule 7.12.2, as the RBNZ’s Standards require Conversion to occur immediately;
b. HBL will be required, as a condition of this waiver, to disclose to the market the full terms and conditions of the Heartland Notes and the implications of this waiver and NZXR is satisfied that this will inform the holders of the Heartland Notes and HBL  Shares that on the occurrence of a Conversion, the market will not be given advance notice;
c. the condition in paragraph 5(b) will ensure that holders of Heartland Notes, holders of HBL Shares and the market will have notice of all information about the Conversion that is known at the date of the Information Memorandum.  The condition in paragraph 5(a) will ensure that all other information that is required to be disclosed under Rule 7.12.2 is disclosed as soon as practicable;
d. if a Conversion occurs, HBL will be required by the terms of the Deed Poll to give notice to holders of Heartland Notes as soon as practicable, that Conversion has occurred.
Application 2 – Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.3.1 and Rule 7.5.1
Decision
7.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 8 below, and on the basis that the information provided by HBL is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZXR grants HBL waivers from Rule 7.3.1 and Rule 7.5.1, so that HBL is not required to comply with Rule 7.3.1 and Rule 7.5.1 for the issue of HBL Shares on a Conversion.
8.The waivers in paragraph 7 above are provided on the conditions that:
a. the full terms and conditions of the Heartland Notes are released to NZX on the issue date of the Heartland Notes together with disclosure that Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing shareholders because the terms and conditions do not include a cap on the maximum number of HBL Shares that may be issued on Conversion;
b. the waivers, their conditions and their implications (including disclosure that Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing shareholders because the terms and conditions do not include a cap on the maximum number of HBL Shares that may be issued on Conversion) are disclosed in any Offering Document for HBL Shares;
c. the waivers, their conditions and their implications (including disclosure that Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing shareholders because the terms and conditions do not include a cap on the maximum number of HBL Shares that may be issued on Conversion) are disclosed in HBL's annual report; and
d. details of the Heartland Notes on issue are contained in HBL's full year and half year disclosure statements in accordance with the Registered Bank Disclosure Statements (New Zealand Incorporated Registered Banks) Order 2014 (as amended from time to time).
Reasons
9.In coming to the decision to provide the waivers set out in paragraph 8 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.in order to comply with the RBNZ’s Standards, HBL must ensure that when the Heartland Notes are issued there are no legal or other impediments to the issue of the HBL Shares upon a Conversion. The issue of the HBL Shares must be immediate and automatic in these circumstances and there will not be an opportunity to seek shareholder approval in order for HBL to comply with Rule 7.3.1 and Rule 7.5.1;
b. the policy of Rule 7.5.1 is to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on a change to the capital structure of an Issuer, which would result in a change to the effective control of that Issuer.  At the time the Heartland Notes are issued, HBL cannot determine whether any person's effective control would increase if HBL Shares are issued on a Conversion and therefore whether shareholder approval under Rule 7.5.1 will be required;
c. HBL has submitted that Conversion can only occur in the unusual circumstances of a non-viability trigger event. NZXR is comfortable that the terms of the Heartland Notes will provide adequate protection to shareholders that Conversion will only occur on a non-viability trigger event; and
d. NZXR is satisfied that the conditions imposed will provide the HBL shareholders, and potential investors, access to information about the possible issue of HBL Shares if a Conversion occurs, as well as the amount of Heartland Notes on issue.  
Application 3 – Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 9.1.1
Decision
10. Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 11 below, and on the basis that the information provided by HBL is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZXR grants HBL a waiver from Rule 9.1.1 in respect of HBL Shares issued on a Conversion. 
11. The waiver in paragraph 10 above is provided on the conditions that:
a. the full terms and conditions of the Heartland Notes are released to NZX on the issue date of the Heartland Notes together with disclosure that Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing shareholders because the terms and conditions do not include a cap on the maximum number of HBL Shares that may be issued on Conversion;
b. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in the Information Memorandum; 
c. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in any Offering Document for HBL Shares; and 
d. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in HBL's annual report.
Reasons
12. In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 10 above, NZXR has considered that:
a. the purpose of Rule 9.1 is to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on major transactions of an Issuer. At the time the Heartland Notes are issued, HBL is unable to determine whether the issue of HBL Shares on a Conversion will require shareholder approval under Rule 9.1; 
b. in order to comply with the RBNZ’s Standards, HBL must ensure that when the Heartland Notes are issued, among other things, there are no legal or other impediments to the issue of the HBL Shares upon a Conversion. The issue of the HBL Shares must be immediate and automatic in these circumstances and HBL has submitted that there will not be an opportunity to seek shareholder approval if Rule 9.1.1 is triggered;
c. HBL has submitted that Conversion can only occur in the unusual circumstances of a non-viability trigger event.  NZXR is comfortable that the terms of the Heartland Notes allow for Conversion in very limited circumstances; and
d. the issue of HBL Shares on a Conversion is consistent with the policy of the exemption to Rule 9.1.1 stated in Rule 9.1.3(c).
Application 4 – Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 9.2.1
Decision
13. Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 14 below, and on the basis that the information provided by HBL is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZXR grants HBL a waiver from Rule 9.2.1 in respect of HBL Shares issued on a Conversion. 
14. The waiver in paragraph 13 above is provided on the conditions that:
a. the full terms and conditions of the Heartland Notes are released to NZX on the issue date of the Heartland Notes;
b. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in the Information Memorandum;
c. the waiver, its conditions and its implications are disclosed in any Offering Document for HBL Shares; and 
d. the waivers, their conditions and their implications are disclosed in HBL's annual report.
Reasons
15. In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 13 above, NZXR has considered that:
a. the purpose of Rule 9.2 is to provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on material transactions with related parties of an Issuer. At the time of issue of the Heartland Notes, HBL is unable to determine whether the issue of HBL Shares on a Conversion will require shareholder approval under Rule 9.2;
b. in order to comply with the RBNZ’s Standards, HBL must ensure that when the Heartland Notes are issued, among other things, there are no legal or other impediments to the issue of the HBL Shares upon a Conversion. The issue of the HBL Shares must be immediate and automatic in these circumstances and HBL has submitted that there will not be an opportunity to seek shareholder approval if Rule 9.2 is triggered;
c. the waiver will only apply where HBL shares are issued on a Conversion. Conversion will be automatic and will be on the terms set out in the Deed Poll. Accordingly there is no scope for related parties to influence the issue of HBL Shares to them; 
d. related parties will participate in the issue on the same terms as all other holders of the Heartland Notes. Therefore there is no value transfer to related parties over and above the value received by any other holder; and
e. the proposed condition at paragraph 14(a) above will ensure that existing and prospective shareholders of HBL have access to information about the possible issue of HBL Shares if a Conversion occurs.
Confidentiality
16. HBL has requested this decision be kept confidential until HBL has made an announcement of the offer of the Heartland Notes. 
17. In accordance with Footnote 1 to Rule 1.11.2, NZXR grants HBL’s request.
 
Appendix One
1. Heartland Bank Limited (HBL) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board. 
2. As a registered bank, HBL must comply with its conditions of registration, which are issued by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), including having a level of regulatory capital. HBL intends to issue regulatory capital in the form of convertible notes.  HBL intends to offer up to AUD$30 million of subordinated, convertible notes (Heartland Notes), by way of private placement to wholesale investors in Australia and New Zealand under an information memorandum (Information Memorandum).
3. The Heartland Notes will be classified as debt in the financial statements of HBL, and will be treated as Tier 2 capital for HBL under the RBNZ document “Capital Adequacy Framework (Standardised Approach)” (BS2A) dated November 2015 (RBNZ’s Standards).
4. HBL may elect to redeem:
a. all or some of the Heartland Notes on each interest payment date that occurs after five years from the issue date of the Heartland Notes (each an Optional Redemption Date); or
b. all or some of the Heartland Notes if a specific tax or regulatory event occurs.
Early redemption is subject to certain conditions being satisfied, including obtaining the consent of the RBNZ.
5. HBL must redeem all of the Heartland Notes that have not previously been redeemed, converted, or written off, on the maturity date (10 years after the issue date of the Heartland Notes).
6. To qualify as Tier 2 capital, an instrument must fulfil certain criteria, including providing an unrestricted commitment of funds and being available to absorb losses if the bank is in financial stress. The terms of Heartland Notes must meet this criteria, in particular:
a. Subordination: The Heartland Notes are subordinated in right of repayment to all depositors and unsubordinated creditors of HBL;
b. Term: Heartland Notes have a term of 10 years, subject to HBL’s right to redeem the Heartland Notes early as detailed in paragraph 4 above;
c. Interest payments: Interest payments are scheduled to be paid quarterly in arrear, but are subject to the condition that HBL is solvent at the time payment is due and HBL will remain solvent immediately after the payment is made; and
d. Loss absorption: All or some of the Heartland Notes may be required to be converted into ordinary shares in HBL (HBL Shares) if a non-viability trigger event occurs in respect of HBL. A non-viability trigger event will occur if a determination is made by either the RBNZ or the statutory manager. Loss absorption occurs as follows:
i. If HBL is required to convert Heartland Notes because a non-viability trigger event has occurred:
1. each Heartland Note that is to be converted is immediately redeemed for an amount equal to its face value provided that HBL must apply the redemption amount by way of payment for the subscription amount for the new HBL Shares; and
2. subject to the redemption amount being applied as set out in point 1 above, HBL will issue to the relevant Heartland Note holder a number of HBL Shares, determined in accordance with a formula set out in the terms of the Heartland Notes, in schedule 1 to the deed poll for the Heartland Notes (Deed Poll), 
(together, Conversion).
ii. As a consequence of Conversion, holders of Heartland Notes will cease to hold the Heartland Notes that have been converted and to have any rights under those Heartland Notes, and instead they will hold HBL Shares.  If for any reason the Heartland Notes that are to be converted are not able to be converted when required following a non-viability trigger event, those Heartland Notes will be written off.
7. The Heartland Notes will only convert into HBL Shares on the occurrence of a non-viability trigger event, and will not convert into HBL Shares in any other circumstances.
8. As a registered bank, HBL is subject to the prudential supervision of the RBNZ. Among other requirements, HBL must publish quarterly disclosure statements which contain financial information about the bank.

 
Appendix Two
Rule 7.3 Issue of New Equity Securities
7.3.1  No Issuer shall issue any Equity Securities unless:
(a) the precise terms and conditions of the specific proposal to issue those Equity Securities have been approved (subject to Rule 7.3.3) by separate resolutions (passed by a simple majority of Votes) of holders of each Class of Quoted Equity Securities of the Issuer whose rights or entitlements could be affected by that issue, and that issue is completed within the time specified in Rule 7.3.2; or
(b) the issue is made in accordance with any of Rules 7.3.4. to Rule 7.3.11.
Rule 7.5 Issues and Buybacks of Securities Affecting Control
7.5.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Rules 7.3 and Rule 7.6, no issue, acquisition, or redemption of Securities shall be made by an Issuer if:

(b) that person or group of Associated Persons is entitled before the issue, acquisition, or redemption to exercise, or direct the exercise of, not less than 1% of the total Votes attaching to Securities of the Issuer;
unless the precise terms and conditions of the issue, acquisition or redemption have been approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Issuer.
Rule 7.12  Announcements 
7.12.2 Where any benefit is to be paid or distributed on Quoted Securities (including dividends, interest or bonus issues) or any Conversion of Securities or call on Securities is to take place, the Issuer shall give to NZX, forthwith after any Director's recommendation and at least 10 Business Days before the Record Date to determine entitlements or obligations, full details of the benefit, Conversion or call, including the information in the table below.

9.1.1 An Issuer shall not (subject to Rule 9.1.3) enter into any transaction or series of linked or related transactions to acquire, sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of (otherwise than by way of charge) assets of the Issuer or assets to be held by the Issuer:
(a) which would change the essential nature of the business of the Issuer; or
(b) in respect of which the gross value is in excess of 50% of the Average Market Capitalisation of the Issuer;
except with the prior approval of an Ordinary Resolution of the Issuer or a special resolution if that Issuer must obtain approval of the transaction or transactions by a special resolution under section 129 of the Companies Act 1993.
Rule 9.2 Transactions with Related Parties
9.2.1 An Issuer shall not enter into a Material Transaction if a Related Party is, or is likely to become:
(a)  a direct or indirect party to the Material Transaction, or to at least one of a related series of transactions of which the Material Transaction forms part; or
(b)  in the case of a guarantee or other transaction of the nature referred to in paragraph (d) of the definition of Material Transaction, a direct or indirect beneficiary of such guarantee or other transaction,
unless that Material Transaction is approved by an Ordinary Resolution of the Issuer.

  NZX Release

Heartland Announces Strike Price for Dividend Reinvestment Plan

3 April 2017

Heartland Bank Limited (Heartland) (NZX: HBL) advises that the strike price for shares to be issued under its Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) in lieu of the cash dividend payable on 7 April 2017 is $1.5939 per share.

The strike price has been determined in accordance with the DRP as the volume weighted average sale price for a Heartland share calculated on all trades of Heartland shares which took place through the NZX Main Board over the period of 5 trading days immediately following the record date of 24 March 2017, less a 2.5% discount.

Shareholders who have made a valid election to participate in the DRP will receive Heartland shares, instead of cash, in respect of the dividend payable on 7 April 2017.

A revised Appendix 7 in respect of the dividend and the new shares to be issued under the DRP is attached.

    Notification of Issue of Securities 
    3:31pm,  7 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Release

Notification of Issue of Securities pursuant to Listing Rule 7.12.1

7 April 2017

For the purposes of Listing Rules 5.2.5 and 7.12.1 of the NZX Main Board Listing Rules, Heartland Bank Limited (Heartland) advises that the following securities have been issued to certain institutional investors:

Class of Security: Subordinated unsecured convertible notes (Notes).  The Notes are not quoted on the NZX Debt Market. If a non-viability trigger event occurs, the Notes will convert into fully paid ordinary shares in Heartland  (Conversion)

ISIN: AU3FN0035416

Number of Notes issued: 20,000

Nominal value (if any): A$10,000 per Note

Issue price: A$10,000 per Note and A$20,000,000 in aggregate for all Notes

Payment: Cash

Amount paid up: Fully paid up

Percentage of total class issued: 100% of the total number of Notes

Principal terms of the Notes: Refer to the Term Sheet accompanying this notice. 

Reason for issue: Approximately 72% of the face value of the Notes will be recognised as Tier 2 Capital, a type of regulatory capital, for Heartland. The proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be used for Heartland's general corporate purposes. 

Specific authority for issue: The Notes are issued pursuant to a Deed Poll dated 31 March 2017. The issue was approved by a resolution of the board of directors of Heartland.  

Terms or details of issue: Refer to the Term Sheet accompanying this notice.

Total number of Notes after issue: 20,000

Treasury stock (for acquisition only): Not applicable

Date of issue: 7 April 2017

Additional information: If a non-viability trigger event occurs, Conversion will occur immediately and without prior notice to the market.  
There is no cap on the number of ordinary shares in Heartland (HBL Shares) that can be issued by Heartland on Conversion.  This means Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing holders of HBL Shares.  The level of potential dilution for existing holders of HBL Shares will depend on the price of HBL Shares and the spot NZ$/A$ exchange rate at the time of Conversion.

  Goodman (NZ) Limited, the Manager of Goodman Property Trust (“GMT” or “Trust”), has confirmed that GMT’s financial result for the year ending 31 March 2017 will contain a significant property revaluation.

Draft valuation reports from independent valuers indicate that GMT’s property portfolio will record a full year gain of around $115 million, or approximately 5%.

The positive result means the portfolio has a current value of more than $2.4 billion . 

John Dakin, Chief Executive Officer said, “Continued demand for high quality industrial property is reflected in the strength of this valuation result.

The revaluation remains subject to finalisation and independent audit. Further details will be provided with the Trust’s FY17 annual result announcement on 18 May 2017.

    FMS  announces proposed further acquisition
    8:47am,  6 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Future Mobility Solutions [NZX: FMS]
Monday 6th of March 2017: 

The Company is pleased to announce a further transaction with the proposed Acquisition of all of the shares in Sealegs Europe SAS from the Company's largest ultimate shareholder, Avenport Investment Corporation (“Avenport”), for an effective purchase price of NZD1,337,500.  The purchase price will be satisfied by the issue of 5,350,000 ordinary shares in the Company at an issue price of NZD0.25 per share. 

Sealegs Europe SAS is the master dealer that currently represents the Company in Europe, Africa and a number of other countries and territories in the Indian Ocean.   
As the Acquisition involves an issue of shares to a related party of the Company that will increase Avenport’s voting rights in the Company, it is conditional upon shareholder approval. 

To this end, a notice of shareholders meeting of the Company will be despatched as soon as practicable to approve the Acquisition. Such notice will also contain an independent adviser’s report and appraisal report in accordance with the Takeovers Code and the listing rules of the NZX Main Board.  Assuming shareholder approval is given, the Company intends to close the Acquisition promptly following such approval.

    Malaysian Government Orders 23 Sealegs Craft
    8:35am, 29 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Future Mobility Solutions [NZX: FMS]
Subsidiary: Sealegs International Ltd, Tuesday 29th of March:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wholly owned FMS subsidiary, Sealegs International Limited, today announced it has received an order of 23 additional Sealegs amphibious craft to be supplied to the Malaysian Civil Defence Force. 
This follows from the proven use of existing Sealegs craft in operation in Malaysia, across a range of government sectors for both security and first-response. The multi-unit order is worth in excess of NZD$3 million and all 23 Sealegs craft will be due for delivery over the next 12 months.

Sealegs CEO David McKee Wright said “This is the largest single order for amphibious craft in the history of Sealegs. It evidences our strong relationship with the Malaysian Government and the already proven performance of Sealegs as first-response and emergency rescue craft. He went on to say “an order of this size will help our operating position over the next 12 months and set a precedent for other international government departments”.
The Sealegs application in Malaysia will be multi-faceted. With the amphibious craft’s primary purpose to be flood response, outside the flood-prone monsoon season the just-ordered Sealegs will join the existing fleet stationed across 33 locations around the country’s coastline providing emergency rescue services.

HALF YEAR REVIEW
From the Chairman and Managing Director

The Directors are pleased to present the consolidated financial result of Freightways Limited (Freightways) for the half year ended 31 December 2016. This report discusses the result, reviews the operations of each division and provides an outlook for the financial year ending 30 June 2017. 

Highlights include the strength of the underlying volume growth and margin in the express package &amp; business mail division, progress to timetable and budget of establishing major purpose-built facilities in Sydney and Christchurch and the related relocation projects, the execution of robust contingency plans that ensured minimal service disruption following the significant impact of the North Canterbury earthquake and the performance of our information management businesses, other than TIMG Australia, which was primarily affected by a poor result at LitSupport. 

Operating performance

The below table (refer attachments) presents the reported half year result compared to the prior comparative period (pcp), both before and after the inclusion of non-recurring items:

$ million - December 2016 Result before non-recurring items; Non-recurring items; December 2016 Result after non-recurring items; December 2015 Result; Increase %

Revenue: 272.8; -; 272.8; 254.9; 7.0%
EBITDA(i): 55.8; 4.0; 51.8; 51.2; 1.2%
EBITA(ii): 50.1; 4.0; 46.1; 45.0; 2.4%
NPATA(iii): 34.8; 4.5; 30.3; 28.7; 5.6%
NPAT(iv): 34.0; 4.5; 29.5; 27.7; 6.2%
EPS(cents): 21.9; 2.9; 19.0; 17.9; 6.1%

Notes:
i. Operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
ii. Operating profit before interest, tax, and amortisation. 
iii. Net profit after tax (NPAT), before amortisation. 
iv. Profit for the half year attributable to shareholders.
 
The results discussed throughout this commentary exclude the impact of the following non-recurring items that the Directors believe should not be included when assessing the underlying half year trading results:
• A non-recurring benefit before tax of $5.6 million relating to previously accrued final acquisition payments that are no longer expected to be required. The interim dividend was calculated excluding this non-cash benefit. 
• A non-recurring cost before tax of $1.6 million relating to the relocation of the TIMG business in Sydney.  
 
Dividend

The Directors have declared an interim dividend of 13 cents per share, fully imputed at a tax rate of 28%, being a 2% increase above the pcp dividend of 12.75 cents per share. This represents a payout of approximately $20.1 million compared with $19.7 million for the pcp dividend. The dividend will be paid on 3 April 2017. The record date for determination of entitlements to the dividend is 17 March 2017.

The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will not be offered in relation to this dividend. As a capital management tool, the application of the DRP will be reviewed for each future dividend.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

Divisional results for the half year ended 31 December 2016 are provided below for the express package &amp; business mail division and the information management division. 

Express Package &amp; Business Mail

Operating revenue of $202.5 million was 8% higher than the pcp. EBITA of $34.8 million was 7% higher than the pcp. 

The express package &amp; business mail division operates a multi-brand strategy in the domestic market through New Zealand Couriers, Post Haste, Castle Parcels, NOW Couriers, SUB60, Security Express, Kiwi Express, Stuck, Pass The Parcel, DX Mail and Dataprint.

Volume and revenue growth throughout the half year was strong, particularly so in the peak December month. Increased activity amongst existing customers and the winning of new customers contributed to this growth. Disruption surcharges were introduced during December to offset increased linehaul and delivery costs following November’s North Canterbury earthquake. Overall, costs have been well contained and the higher operating costs involved with the transition to a new aircraft operating model reduced through the second quarter. Key matters:

• The transition to Boeing 737-400 aircraft is progressing well. The four superseded freighter aircraft owned by FRE have all been sold for their combined book value of $1 million. Three of the aircraft were sold subsequent to the end of the half year. The Boeing 737-400 aircraft provided important capacity during the peak volume period leading into Christmas.  
• The new airside facility currently being constructed at Christchurch airport is on schedule. This facility will be automated with physical conveyor equipment, which is currently being assembled on site, and IT developed collaboratively by Freightways’ IT team and the European-based suppliers. Overall this project is running to budget expectations. 
• Increased resourcing of the IT team has enabled the progression of a number of key projects in support of Freightways’ strategic intent to be a technology leader in the markets it operates in.  
• The North Canterbury earthquake had a significant impact on the division’s inter-island and intra-South Island linehaul services. Providing a consistent nationwide overnight and two-day delivery service relies on the network operating to a strict timetable. An issue at one point in the linehaul system has a ripple effect throughout the entire network and if not addressed, will severely affect customers who are reliant on the performance of this service. Immediately following the earthquake, the businesses developed a contingency plan to address the loss of State Highway One in the upper South Island and the initially disrupted inter-islander ferries to ensure the least possible impact on customers. This plan required the deployment of several additional linehaul trucks, drivers and depot handling staff at key sortation hubs throughout the country. The teamwork and passion displayed by Freightways’ people to provide the best possible service in working through this significant challenge was and remains outstanding. Likewise, the support of customers during this period is acknowledged and appreciated. 
 
Freightways’ business mail operator, DX Mail, further expanded its postie network and now businesses in most urban locations throughout New Zealand are able to choose DX Mail for overnight and 5-day per week delivery of their standard-priced letters. Despite the decline of the overall physical letter market, the demand for DX Mail’s suite of services is increasing. Dataprint, which provides physical and digital transactional mailhouse services, increased market share in all of its service lines, both physical and digital. 

Information Management  

Operating revenue of $71.1 million was 3% higher than the pcp. EBITA of $13.4 million was 6% lower than the pcp.

The information management division operates under the brands of The Information Management Group (TIMG) and Shred-X.

Strong results from Shred-X and TIMG New Zealand were primarily offset by poor performance from TIMG Australia’s LitSupport business, which led to some restructuring and related costs. Key matters:

• LitSupport has performed at the bottom end of the range of expectations set at the time of acquiring the business. While forecast revenue growth has been achieved, forecast EBITDA growth has not occurred. This outcome was anticipated as a possibility at that time and hence the payment for this business was structured to reduce Freightways’ financial risk should this occur. As previously announced, the vendors of LitSupport refunded A$5 million of the initial A$17.1 million purchase price in March 2016. Based on the forecast for the current year, the effective multiple of EBITDA applicable to the reduced purchase price remains at approximately the same level as originally expected. This has, however, meant that an earn-out payment of $5.3 million previously accrued is not now anticipated to be paid to the vendors and accordingly it has been written back to the income statement as a non-cash, non-recurring benefit. Recent restructuring of LitSupport and the winning of a number of new contracts is expected to assist in improving LitSupport’s performance over time.
• During the prior year, it was announced that Freightways would invest in the relocation of three Sydney-based information management facilities into a single purpose-built facility. The cost of this relocation has at this stage been $1.6 million of the $2.5 million budget for this project and overall is tracking to budget expectations and timetable. Operating from a single site will deliver operating efficiencies that will contribute to a positive return on this investment from the completion of this project in June this year. 
• Demand for the digital services offered by TIMG and the e-destruction services offered by Shred-X continues to gain momentum. It is expected that these new revenue streams will become an increasingly important part of the overall information management division’s revenue and earnings in the near to medium term. 
• The severity of the North Canterbury earthquake had repercussions for the division’s document storage facilities in Wellington. While the racking did its job and withstood the impact of the earthquake, its structural integrity was compromised, particularly in the major site located in Porirua. This has resulted in the likelihood of having to repair or replace most, if not all, of the Porirua racking and will involve repositioning boxes while repairs are made or replacement racking is installed. Freightways carries comprehensive insurance for events such as this. The related deductible has been expensed as a corporate cost. Thanks to the strong service culture within the TIMG business, the quick actions of its people and the support of key suppliers, the service disruption to TIMG’s customers has been minimal. Again the support of customers during this period is acknowledged and appreciated.    
 
Internal service providers

Fieldair Holdings, through its subsidiary of Air Freight NZ, operates a joint venture company that leases and operates the Boeing 737-400 aircraft fleet that provides Freightways’ overnight airfreight linehaul service. Fieldair also provides specialist engineering and contracting services to the general aviation market. Parceline Express provides Freightways’ road linehaul service. As volumes have grown, the services provided by these businesses have adapted to ensure the provision of quality sustainable capacity. 

Freightways Information Services provides IT development and support to the express package &amp; business mail division. This team is responsible for providing the front line businesses with robust and secure information management systems and supporting their technology-related strategic objectives.   

Corporate 

Corporate costs have increased compared to the pcp, primarily due to expensing the insurance deductibles related to earthquake insurance claims. 

Net debt levels are unchanged from the pcp at $159 million. A finance facility has also been established with a US-based lender on the same terms as those that are in place with Freightways’ existing banking syndicate. 

Capital expenditure during the half year of $10 million, including the investment made in the new Christchurch and Sydney premises, has been funded from operating cash flows.

OUTLOOK

Volumes and activity evidenced in this first half result support Freightways’ expectations of again improving its overall year-on-year performance. The markets in which Freightways operates in both New Zealand and Australia remain positive and the company is experiencing increasing demand for the services it provides.  

As had been stated in the prior annual result announcement and as is evident in this half year announcement, results from the express package &amp; business mail division will be partly offset by the investment being made in increased capacity in the information management division to accommodate current and future expected growth and poor performance of LitSupport in this half year. Expectations are for improved performance from LitSupport in the second half of the financial year. 

The next six months will see the completion of the major projects that are underway to relocate the businesses in Sydney and Christchurch, with the full benefits relating to these projects on target to be realised in the 2018 financial year.

Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to be approximately $24 million. Overall cash flows are expected to remain strong for the remainder of the 2017 financial year.
    
Strategic growth opportunities, including acquisitions and alliances that complement existing capabilities, will be executed where they make commercial sense. 
 
CONCLUSION

The strength of the Freightways business models, the expertise of its people and the positive features of the markets it operates in are once again evident in this half year result.
 
The Directors acknowledge the outstanding work and ongoing dedication of the Freightways team of people throughout New Zealand and Australia.

    The Majestic Centre tower seismic strengthening completes
    8:34am,  7 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Kiwi Property is pleased to advise that the seismic strengthening works at The Majestic Centre tower have completed, with new lease agreements highlighting the strength of tenant demand for buildings rated ‘low risk’ for seismic performance. 

Chris Gudgeon, Chief Executive, said: “This has been one of the most complex seismic strengthening programmes ever undertaken in New Zealand, with our programme of works undertaken in stages over a 4.5-year period to keep the building operational throughout.

“From the outset, we received strong support from our tenants and, since works began, we have undertaken leasing deals equivalent to 93% of the building’s office area.  As a result, the building has a weighted average lease term of 6.7 years – which shows tremendous support for the outcomes we have been able to achieve at The Majestic Centre,” said Mr Gudgeon. 

The project reached practical completion on 31 January 2017, with the tower now achieving a performance-rating equivalent to 100% of New Building Standards (NBS) [NOTE 1].

NOTE 1: The 100% NBS performance rating, provided by Holmes Consulting LP, has been based on a performance based assessment to ASCE-41 performance objectives at Life Safety and Collapse Prevention limit states for 100% and 150% earthquake load levels to NZS1170.5:2004 (New Zealand Loadings Standard) respectively.

“Since the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, and the subsequent Wellington and Kaikoura earthquakes, we have witnessed a surge in tenant demand for buildings that are highly rated for seismic performance,” said Mr Gudgeon.

The Earthquake Commission has been a long-standing tenant within The Majestic Centre and recommitted to a new lease in the building during the seismic upgrade project.

Hugh Cowan, General Manager Reinsurance, Research and Education, Earthquake Commission, said: “Since the Canterbury earthquakes, Kiwi Property has displayed integrity and leadership in understanding earthquake building risk and overcoming the technical challenges to reduce it.  They proactively engaged everyone in the building – openly sharing their understanding of the situation and what they planned to do to fix it.
 
“Naturally, undertaking a project of such scale and complexity in a fully tenanted site at times involved additional challenges, but the outcome today exemplifies what can be achieved by a determined building owner employing the right expertise and with the goodwill of many parties.  The strengthening of The Majestic Centre is a world-class example of what can be done to improve the seismic performance of buildings while keeping them operational.”

Michael Holloway, GM Commercial, said: “We have been fielding increasing tenant inquiry from Wellington office tenants who recognise the strength of the tower and the quality of the building.

“Today, we are pleased to announce that we have secured a further tenancy agreement for a new nine-year lease over 1,021 sqm of space, commencing in May 2017,” Mr Holloway said, noting that seismic performance was a strong motivator for the new tenant to move to The Majestic Centre. 

Kiwi Property also recently reached agreement with Summerset Group Holdings Limited for a new 12-year lease to accommodate their growth requirements, increasing their premises by 782 sqm to 1,803 sqm progressively from April 2017.

Key tenants within The Majestic Centre include:
&gt; Airways Corporation
&gt; Cigna
&gt; Earthquake Commission
&gt; Ernst &amp; Young
&gt; Government of Japan
&gt; NZTA
&gt; NZ Trade and Enterprise
&gt; Opus
&gt; Summerset Group
&gt; Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
&gt; Training Rooms Wellington

ABOUT THE MAJESTIC CENTRE

One of Wellington’s most recognisable office towers, The Majestic Centre offers 21 levels of A-grade office accommodation for high-quality tenants from the public and private sectors. 

Kiwi Property’s market leading commitment to strengthening works has resulted in the building now being recognised as one of the most attractive office accommodation options for tenants in the Wellington market.

Providing context to the scale of the strengthening works involved, Kiwi Property’s contractor Fletcher Building poured 1,300 cubic metres of concrete, installed 1,325 tonnes of structural steel, laid 53.2 kilometres of post-tensioning strand and inserted 53,500 bolts and anchors.  During the project’s peak construction period, construction crews worked in two shifts covering 21 hours a day, seven days a week.  The strengthening project has cost in excess of $83 million.

In 2013, while the seismic upgrade was in progress, earthquakes in Cook Strait produced moderate shaking in Wellington, which was recorded on a GeoNet array of sensors installed in The Majestic Centre for research purposes several years earlier.  The measurements of the shaking gave added confidence to continued occupancy of the tower, and also provided a timely cross-check and validation of design assumptions for The Majestic Centre upgrade.

At completion of the seismic strengthening upgrade, 97% of the building’s net lettable area achieves a performance-rating equivalent to 100% of NBS. 

The upper part of the main entrance atrium is rated at 85% NBS. Two small tenancies outside the tower, comprising 3% of the net lettable area, are rated at 40% NBS and may be strengthened in future.

    Amended Commentary – HY17 Interim Report
    3:09pm, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  There is an error in the second paragraph of the Financial Commentary relating to Cash Flow at page 11 of the 2017 Interim Report. 

The paragraph reads:

""The company elected to pre-pay some of its third provisional tax payment in March 2016, which would otherwise have been payable in July, to fully impute the 4 cents per share special dividend paid in September 2016.""

This paragraph should be replaced with the following:

""The company elected to pre-pay some of its third provisional tax payment in March 2016, which would otherwise have been payable in July, to fully impute previously paid special dividends.""

The HY17 Financial Statements and the remainder of the HY17 Interim Report are unaffected. The attached Mercury HY17 Interim Report replaces the one released to NZX and ASX on the morning of 21 February 2017.

    MOA TO PARTNER WITH LEWIS ROAD CREAMERY 
    12:38pm,  9 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  MOA TO PARTNER WITH LEWIS ROAD CREAMERY AS THEY ENTER THE LIQUEUR MARKET AND REAFFIRMS FY17 REVENUE GUIDANCE. 

Moa Group (NZX:MOA ) today announces it will act as the sales and distribution partner for Lewis Road Creamery as they enter the Liqueur market with their new Chocolate Cream Liqueur.  This follows Moa’s  announcement that they act as sales and distribution partner for Wellington craft brewer - ParrotDog, released in October last year. 

Moa announced at its 2016 AGM that it would consider distributing a small set of complementary brands to build scale and breadth of offer to key New Zealand Liquor groups. This may involve distribution agreements, like those with ParrotDog and Lewis Road Creamery, or acquisitions. This strategy is re affirmed as Moa heads through 2017.

Moa also confirms the FY2017 revenue guidance, given last year, of a range of $9.5 to $11.0m.  The Group will give a further market update in April.

  NZX/ASX Release
12 April 2017

METLIFECARE BOARD CHANGES

Metlifecare Limited advises that the company’s two Infratil director representatives, Kevin Baker and William Smales, have resigned from the Board, effective immediately. Their resignations follow the recent sale of Infratil’s 19.91% stake in the company that has now settled. 

Metlifecare Chair Kim Ellis thanked the two directors for their contribution to the Board since being appointed in 2013. “In the three and a half years Kevin and Will have served on Metlifecare’s Board they have both made a valuable contribution to shareholders. Their diligence and expertise has been much appreciated and, on behalf of the Board, I again thank them for their dedication and first class directorships.”

The company will now commence a director search process, using this opportunity to refresh the Board with the governance skills and capabilities required to guide Metlifecare on its accelerated growth path.

    Mercury - HY2017 Results and Interim Report
    8:30am, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  HY2017 demonstrates clear momentum and customer loyalty

&gt;&gt; Solid progress on key strategic initiatives
&gt;&gt; Operating earnings (EBITDAF) up 5.1%
&gt;&gt; Interim dividend of 5.8 cents per share to be paid on 3 April

Favourable North Island hydro conditions have contributed to a 5.1% lift in Mercury’s operating earnings (EBITDAF) to $270 million for HY2017.

The company’s results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 show strong customer loyalty around the new Mercury brand and significant progress on value-enhancing partnerships. These include commercial relationships with global technology leaders Trina Solar, SolaX Power and PlugShare, and Mercury became an exclusive Airpoints(TM) partner with Air New Zealand.

Chair, Joan Withers, says Mercury will pay a fully-imputed interim dividend of 5.8 cents per share on 3 April 2017 to 90,000 owners, including the Crown. This represents 40% of the full-year ordinary dividend guidance of 14.6 cents per share, a 2.1% increase on FY2016.

“Mercury’s owners can have confidence that their business is performing well, and they can see evidence of our customer-led strategy. We have real momentum in the business and a clear focus on value-based opportunities.”

FINANCIAL RESULTS

Mercury’s financial results reflect a strong operating performance, together with above-average rainfall that enabled a 7% increase in hydro generation. Mercury updated forecast FY2017 hydro generation in October (to 4,250GWh).

Chief Executive, Fraser Whineray, says the 2015 closure of the gas-fired Southdown station substantially reduced future carbon obligations and the company took the opportunity to divest some of its carbon credits in HY2017. This generated cash proceeds of $19 million and a gain on sale of $5 million. Net profit after tax was up from $74 million to $113 million due to the improved EBITDAF, movements in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments, and impairments in the prior period. Underlying earnings were up $5 million to $94 million.

Operating costs were down 6% on HY2016 due to lower maintenance costs in the period. Full-year operating costs are forecast to be in line with recent years. Capital expenditure is expected to be $115 million in FY2017 as a result of the company’s current focus on hydro reinvestment and geothermal drilling, which is progressing well.

GROWTH OPTIONS

Alongside the robust results for HY2017, Mrs Withers says the reporting period included solid progress on several key elements of the company’s strategy to create long-term sustainable value.

Highlights included the move to a new Mercury brand, successful customer loyalty initiatives, the launch of New Zealand’s leading solar offering and the development of important partnerships.

The company has also undertaken a broad review of domestic growth options. Mr Whineray says this review, involving external advisors, focused on opportunities with potential to deliver value for customers and help drive progressive returns to Mercury’s owners over time.

“We have established capability and small, but important, new revenue streams in key technologies such as solar and distributed storage to complement our core strength in renewable generation.

“We are investing in the Mercury Research and Development Centre to showcase world-leading solar, battery storage, electric vehicle (EV) charging and other energy technologies in New Zealand conditions. We are also looking beyond the home to opportunities in e-mobility and relevant areas of transportation.”

PARTNERSHIPS

In the six months to 31 December 2016, Mercury announced a range of initiatives being progressed through value-enhancing partnerships.

Mercury has been confirmed by a global leader in solar panel technology and sustainability, Trina Solar, as their preferred residential and commercial sales partner in New Zealand. We are also the exclusive New Zealand supplier of the SolaX-BOX battery, which offers an advanced and flexible home storage system that complements solar production and can provide effective back-up during a power outage.

The company has partnered with global software and services company, PlugShare, on the Electric Highway(TM) to increase the visibility of the full range of EV charging locations to support electric vehicle growth in New Zealand.

Another substantial initiative, led by the chief executives of Mercury and Air New Zealand, saw 30 of New Zealand’s leading businesses commit to a minimum of 30% EVs in their fleets by 2019, representing 1,450 EVs in total.

Mr Whineray says: “This is one of the largest voluntary sustainability initiatives in New Zealand business history, with the potential to take around 3 million kg of carbon emissions out of the environment every year. We also see this as another very meaningful milestone in the uptake of EVs and electricity becoming the transport fuel of choice.”

CUSTOMER LOYALTY

Mr Whineray says the response to the new Mercury brand (launched on 29 July 2016) has been “extremely positive with our people and with our customers”.

Mercury’s customer satisfaction reached record levels during HY2017 and switching rates were more than 3% lower than the market average reported by the Electricity Authority. Customer numbers increased by about 11,000 over the period, largely due to better retention of existing customers, consistent with our focus on rewarding loyalty.

More than 100,000 customers were rewarded with a Free Power Day, and almost 100,000 have registered for Airpoints(TM). Mr Whineray says another significant contributor to loyalty is the popularity of Mercury’s fixed-price contracts.

“This is the single-most successful retail offering in terms of uptake in the New Zealand electricity market, with 1-in-3 Mercury customers opting for the certainty of contracts.”

Mercury’s first Airpoints(TM) offer has moved more than 4,000 customers to two-year contracts and is also expected to be a powerful retention product. He says Mercury has continued to invest in and seamlessly implement updates to key technology platforms to support service to customers and digital engagement.

FY2017 GUIDANCE

The company has revised EBITDAF guidance for the current financial year (FY2017) to $500 million, subject to any material adverse events, significant one-off expenses or other unforeseeable circumstances including hydrological conditions.

Attached are the following documents in relation to Mercury's financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2016:

    Conditional agreements signed for NPT Partnership Proposal 
    8:34am, 30 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Kiwi Property has today entered into conditional agreements recording the terms and conditions of its partnership proposal with NPT Limited (NPT).

As previously announced on 13 December 2016, Kiwi Property has proposed a strategic partnership with NPT.  Key elements of the partnership proposal include:

&gt; Kiwi Property selling North City Shopping Centre and The Majestic Centre to NPT for total consideration of $230 million.

&gt; NPT issuing approximately $48 million of new shares to Kiwi Property (depending on the value of NPT's shares at the time of the issue). As a result, Kiwi Property would become a cornerstone investor in NPT with a shareholding of 19.9%.

&gt; Kiwi Property acquiring the right to manage NPT with a payment to NPT of $6 million.

&gt; NPT pursuing a clearly defined ‘Core-Plus’ investment strategy with access to Kiwi Property’s specialist management capabilities.

The partnership proposal and associated transaction documents are conditional upon NPT’s shareholders approving the acquisition of the two properties from Kiwi Property and the issue of new shares to Kiwi Property, NPT undertaking an entitlement offer and raising at least $90 million under that offer, NPT finalising funding arrangements on terms acceptable to NPT, and NPT obtaining approval from the Overseas Investment Office.

Further information regarding the conditions and each of the transaction documents is contained in the attached notice of special meeting of NPT shareholders and accompanying presentation, which NPT has today released to the market.

Kiwi Property Chief Executive, Chris Gudgeon, said: “The partnership proposal will align the interests of the two listed property companies and provide a clear pathway to grow value for both companies.”

“The proposal has the potential to deliver NPT shareholders with an immediate lift in earnings and increases NPT’s scale and relevance, positioning the company to grow and prosper.”

“Our proposed management agreement with NPT is best-in-class and offers NPT shareholders an ability to terminate the agreement without cause, if they should ever deem this to be in the best interests of the company, at some point in the future,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Kiwi Property’s interests will be aligned with NPT shareholders’ through its 19.9% shareholding in NPT and we will be strongly motivated under the terms of the management agreement to perform for NPT shareholders,” said Mr Gudgeon.

Kiwi Property Chair, Mark Ford, said: “This partnership proposal is a logical opportunity to create further value for our shareholders by using our existing property and funds management platform to generate additional management fee income.”

“We will retain an interest in North City Shopping Centre and The Majestic Centre through our shareholding in NPT and the proposal also serves to release capital which we can use to fund our planned expansion of Sylvia Park Shopping Centre.”

“If we receive the support of NPT shareholders to our proposal, we can help drive NPT’s future investment performance by using our specialist management capabilities to intensively manage their assets and by seeking investment opportunities that create further value for NPT shareholders,” said Mr Ford.

NPT shareholders will vote on the partnership proposal on 21 April 2017.

A copy of NPT’s Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders and the accompanying presentation is attached to this announcement.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    2:23pm, 23 Mar 2017 | WAV/RULE
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK)
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants MCK a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its Preference Shares for a period of twelve months from 23 March 2017 to allow MCK to have fewer than 25% of the Preference Shares held by less than 500 Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding.
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.the Directors of MCK certify to NZXR, in a form acceptable to NZXR, that allowing the Preference Shares to remain quoted is in the best interests of holders of the Preference Shares; 
b.MCK clearly and prominently discloses the waiver, its conditions, and the implications in its half-year and annual reports; 
c.MCK consistently monitors the total number of Members of the Public holding Preference Shares and the percentage of Preference Shares held by Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding and provides NZXR with quarterly updates from the date the waiver is granted during the period of the waiver, such updates to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter; and 
d.MCK notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the total number of Members of the Public holding Preference Shares, and/or the percentage of Preference Shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
5.Capitalised terms that are not defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.
Reasons
6.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the Capital Reduction Scheme undertaken in July 2014 contributed to the decline in spread since the 2014 Waiver was granted. MCK has advised that since the Capital Reduction Scheme was implemented, there has not been a significant decrease in the number of Preference Shareholders;
b.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, MCK would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the Preference Shares. MCK submits that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of MCK and its Directors;
c.holders of the Preference Shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, the condition in paragraph 2(a) provides NZXR with additional comfort that it is in the best interests of holders of the Preference Shares to allow the Preference Shares to remain quoted on the basis that holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections; 
d.the condition contained in paragraph 2(b) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the Preference Shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the Preference Shares, of this waiver and its implications for the Preference Shares;
e.the condition contained in paragraph 2(c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in MCK’s spread over the period of the waiver; and
f.the waiver is granted for a period of 12 months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the Preference Shares in 12 months’ time if MCK considers a waiver is still required. 
 
Appendix One
1.Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary Shares and Preference Shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board. 
2.In 2014 MCK undertook a pro rata renounceable offer (Offer) of redeemable Preference Shares (Preference Shares) to all holders of MCK’s ordinary Shares. At the time of the Offer closing, MCK became aware that it would not meet the spread requirements of NZX Main Board Listing Rule (Rule) 5.2.3 in respect of the Preference shares. 
3.On 25 March 2014, being the date of Quotation of the Preference Shares, a total of 206 Members of the Public held 14.8% of the Preference Shares on issue.
4.On 4 April 2014, NZXR granted MCK a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 for the Preference Shares (2014 Waiver) for a period of`12 months from 25 March 2014. 
5.In July 2014, MCK undertook a capital reduction by way of scheme of arrangement (Capital Reduction Scheme). Between the initial announcement of the Capital Reduction Scheme on 4 June 2014, and its implementation on 17 July 2014, the number of holders of Preference Shares decreased from 207 to 184.
6.In 2015 and 2016, two further waivers from Rule 5.2.3 were granted by NZXR to MCK in relation to the Preference Shares. 
7.As at 28 February 2017, 189 Members of the Public hold 8.4% of the Preference Shares on issue, with 11 custodians and nominees holding Preference Shares. 
8.While Aberdeen Asset Management Limited (Aberdeen) holds 6.4% of the Preference Shares, Aberdeen is not considered to be a Member of the Public for the purposes of the Rules on the basis that Aberdeen holds more than 10% of the ordinary Shares in MCK. 
9.MCK has applied for a Waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of the Preference Shares for a further 12 months from 23 March 2017. 
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities
5.2.3  A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

  Company:  Kathmandu Ltd
Conference Title:  Kathmandu Half-Year Result Analyst Call
Date:  Tuesday 21 March 2017

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Kathmandu Half Year Result Analyst Call.  Today’s call is being recorded.  At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Xavier Simonet.  Please go ahead, sir.  

Xavier Simonet: Good morning.  Thank you very much and welcome to the First Half FY17 result presentation for Kathmandu Holdings.  My name is Xavier Simonet and I am the CEO of the company.  I’m joined on the call by Reuben Casey, our CFO.  We’ll be talking to the presentation, which you can find on the NZX and ASX this morning.  Most of the numbers are in our reporting currency, the New Zealand Dollar, unless when it is specifically mentioned that they are in Australian Dollars or British Pounds.  

Now, let us move to slide three, strategy recap.  Before we read you the first half numbers, I want to spend a moment on our growth initiatives.  We defined key growth strategies last year.  The strategies have not changed and they remain a constant focus for us.  The first strategy is on products.  We are a design-led business and our core strategy is to design great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products.  

Customer-centricity is the key aspect of our strategic approach.  Last year when we reviewed our promotional model and pricing architecture, it was all about understanding the customer journey and making sure that we get customers excited about our commercial activities.  Customer-centricity is also an essential element of our work on products.  We bring market products that offer solutions to our customers who go to the outdoors and on adventure travel.  

Our products answer the functional needs of our customers, but we also want them to be beautiful and stylish.  I have talked about products. We then have two buckets of key strategies: continuous improvement initiatives, and growth initiatives.  Continuous improvement strategies are about doing better, what we do every day, and optimising our existing assets, strengthening our brand equity, optimising sales and profit densities per square metre in our stores, engaging with our customers partly online and through social media and digital marketing and last, driving cost efficiencies with a relentless focus on cost control. 

New growth initiatives are about capturing international opportunities, and marketplaces, and about continuing to open stores in Australasia, when the right opportunities come up.  I will come back to our strategies and give you an update later in the presentation but I wanted to set the scene.  

If you now go to slides five and six, Result Overview.  In a few words, I would like to highlight our key results of the first half of FY17.  Now, sales and gross margin.  What I consider the main achievement of the first half of FY17, is that we grew same store sales in both core markets, Australia and New Zealand.  Overall, same store sales went up 3.4% on last year at constant exchange rates.  More specifically, we managed to deliver strong same store sales growth in Australia, our biggest market by 5%.  Over the last few years, we have invested significant amounts of money in Australia and opened many stores.  Now is the time to leverage our investments, drive market penetration and generate growth.  

Our gross margin was 61.6% in the first six months of FY17.  Our business was significantly impacted by a stronger US dollar.  Moving to costs and efficiencies, we kept a strong focus on keeping costs tight and on delivering efficiencies.  We also believe that our company should be lean and agile.  As an example, we restructured our retail operations at the end of last year to cut the number of layers and we put in place a leaner and more streamlined organisation.  The objective was also to become a more agile business with a short decision-making process between the stores and the head office.  

Coming back to costs, during the first six months of FY17, operating expenses decreased by 100 basis points as a percentage of sales, or $1.8 million and we improved our operating leverage.  Profit-wise, net profit after tax was up 6.4% at $10 million.  

Slide eight, Sales.  Total company sales were flat on last year at actual exchange rates but up 3% at constant exchange rates.  It is worth noting that UK sales were heavily down on last year due to the closure of bricks and mortar stores, as per the strategic decision we made last year.  Online sales continued to enjoy a healthy level of growth at +18% and account for 7.4% of total company sales.  

Reuben Casey: And just to clarify on slide nine, the Australasian sales growth rate is +4.2% on a constant currency basis, so just taking out the effect on the year on year change in the Australian and New Zealand dollar exchange rate.  

Xavier Simonet:  Slide 10, same store sales result.  Same store sales growth is a key performance indicator for us and one of our key strategic pillars.  I’m pleased to report that both our core markets, Australia and New Zealand delivered same store sales growth in the first half of FY17.  Total company same store sales were up 3.4%.  Same store sales growth was particularly strong in Australia at +5%.  It is interesting to note that growth accelerated and that we gained momentum in the second quarter of FY17.  

On 18 November 2016 at our AGM, we indicated that total company same store sales growth was 1.4% for the first 15 weeks of our financial year.  We saw strong momentum through the key Christmas trading period, particularly after Christmas, and so finished the half with 3.4% growth.  The improvements we have made in the business with a very customer-centric view have contributed to this result.  In particular, all the work that has been done to simplify our promotional calendar, to review pricing architecture, to improve our visual merchandising and to connect and engage with our Summit Club members through digital marketing and much improved content.  I also want to highlight the great job done by our product and design team in New Zealand and by our retail store teams.  

Reuben Casey:  Moving on slide 11, gross margin, which is obviously a key driver of our bottom line profitability.  We did expect to be below last year’s first half-year in this half by around about one percentage point as we had favourable hedging rates rolling off.  We did a lot of work with supplier negotiations, new product introductions which we can introduce at the margin we’d like to introduce, pricing changes and had improved stock management to offset any currency impact, which we largely did.  

However, we still had a decline versus last year and probably can attribute half a percentage point due to FX impact, half a percentage point due to having more clearance this year than last year and the remainder due to timing of sales.  We had a good Christmas period but the sales did come slightly later than we planned, which had a slight degradation on our margin achieved.  

Moving on to slide 12 Cost of Doing Business.  As Xavier said at the beginning, this is an ongoing focus for us and we remain very vigilant on costs.  We have managed to achieve operating leverage versus last year and that’s even allowing for the approximately $1 million one-off cost that we incurred in last year’s result.  The main challenge in our cost base is rent, particularly in Australia where rent continues to increase.  In New Zealand, we haven’t seen the same level of increase that we see in Australia.  

We have made good progress in this half in targeting effective market spend, optimising our use of retail labour, which is a benefit of investments we made in rostering systems, and also maintain head office cost control after our restructure last year.  

Let us move on to the earnings summary on slide 13.  The main thing to point out is when we look at constant exchange rates EBITDA and EBIT, it’s $22 million for EBITDA and $15.2 million for EBIT. That’s at a constant New Zealand / Australian reporting exchange rate.  

Okay, if you look at the country results, starting with Australia on slide 15.  We operated two additional stores during this half, both in Queensland, Gold Coast Harbour Town and North Lakes.  In addition, we completed relocations in some major redevelopments of shopping centres at Pacific Fair, Warringah and Doncaster, and expanded our space in Essendon DFO.  As you can see, the cost of operating in Australia continues to produce a lower EBIT margin than New Zealand.  

And if you look at New Zealand on slide 16, we saw a return to historical gross margin levels after positioning ourselves last year with pricing to offset the US dollar impact that we knew was coming.  We had good operating leverage which helped to offset the margin decline and we continued to invest in refurbishments in Queenstown and Sylvia Park.  

The UK on slide 17, we are cycling store closures as Xavier mentioned earlier, so that’s the main reason why sales have dropped and we are striving to achieve a breakeven position, which we have done.  

Looking at cash flow on slide 19, we made some large CAPEX investments in FY16 on our Australia distribution centre, which is based in Melbourne and flagship stores in Melbourne CBD and Adelaide Rundle Mall.  So although the CAPEX we spent this half is a big reduction on last year, it is simply not a reduction in activity, it’s just that we had some major investments last year.  Operating cash flow remains healthy and we will continue to invest in future growth where a return on investment warrants it.  

If you look at the Balance Sheet now on page 20, we continue to achieve a reduction in inventory year on year.  On a per store basis at the half-year point, we are actually below our FY13 levels and this is a decrease from last year of 3.8% on a constant currency basis.  This is really helping us to have a low level of net debt, which of course means a low level of borrowing costs.  Stock turns, we have to acknowledge are still below what we would like them to be, but we expect them to improve for the year-end position.  

Moving on to Dividends on slide 21, we have declared an interim dividend of NZ 4 cents per share which is an increase on last year’s NZ 3 cents per share.  It’s fully imputed, but not franked and is payable on 16 June 2017.  I’ll hand back to Xavier now for our strategy update.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you Reuben.  Moving on to slides 22, 23, 24, and 25. Strategy Update.  Our five focuses remain the same as last year.  Customer-centricity, creating distinctiveness, delivering great value to our customers, inspiring through our brand, cost control and efficiencies.  As I said earlier, designing great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products and solutions remains our first and core strategy.  Our focus is very clear. It is to answer the needs of our customers related to adventure travel.  

We are very proud.  We got earlier this year, the ISPO Gold award for our Terrane Adapt Pack.  ISPO is the main sports and outdoor show in Europe where we exhibited for the first time this year.  The Terrane Adapt Pack is a technical breakthrough, and it is patented.  Now, last year we defined two sets of growth strategies: continuous improvement strategies and new growth initiatives.  Continuous improvement strategies will deliver sales and profit growth in the next couple of years at the same time as we start executing new growth initiatives, which will take more time to get traction and scale.  

Let me give you a few examples of what we have done in regards to continuous improvement initiatives.  As for brand and customer, I believe that more than just a retailer, Kathmandu is a great brand.  We said last year that we wanted to improve our communication and engagement with our customers, particularly by bringing to life through digital and social media channels distinctive and inspirational stories about our heritage, roots, values, our products and our expertise in adventure travel.  In the first half of FY17, we increased our social media reach by 26%, six million people viewed our videos and we had an increase of 366% in click throughs to our website.  

In regards to Summit Club, we continued growing the number of loyal customers from 1.5 million last year to 1.7 million active customers this year.  In February, we’ve sponsored for the first time the iconic Coast to Coast race in New Zealand, which has become the Kathmandu Coast to Coast.  We generated huge content and engagement from this event with customers and our teams.  As a customer-centric organisation, we have put in place in all our stores, the tools that enable us to measure our net promoter score.  The net promoter score was about 74% in New Zealand and Australia in the first half of FY17, a really good performance.  

Now, moving on to store optimisation.  We have conducted trials in a few stores, which were successful and are now implementing the lessons learned, particularly with regards to range and space and location with a strong emphasis on metrics like sales and gross profit densities by square metre.  In terms of pricing architecture and commercial model, well, the high-low model has been successful for Kathmandu in Australasia.  In FY17, we continue the work that we initiated in FY16, defining a more efficient and clear promotional calendar, adjusting our price points, updating our promotional messaging, making our promotional mechanisms more interesting and surprising.  

Connected customer journey, well we’re continuing to invest in online and digital capabilities as online sales continue to grow at a faster pace than brick and mortar sales.  Online sales accounted for 7.7% of total sales in Australia in the first half of FY17 and 6% in New Zealand.  Our ambition remains for online to generate 10% of total company sales.  

As an example of a significant investment we made, we launched at the end of 2016, a responsive website which integrates content and commerce and gives customers access to inspirational content as they browse on our website and shop.  We also deployed marketing cloud tools in the first half of FY17, which provide targeted email capability and give us the opportunity to leverage our Summit Club database and the work we have done on customer segmentation.  

In regards to cost efficiency, optimising our investments, controlling our cost base, simplifying the way we do business, and evaluating the return on investment are key to our approach.  Let me give you a few examples.  In FY16, we invested in footfall counters for all our stores.  Footfall counters are giving us the ability to track traffic and customer conversion and provide us with very much needed data to make critical promotional decisions, marketing investments and adjust trading activities.  

We have also just opened a new Australian distribution centre in Melbourne with automated sortation capabilities.  We expect efficiency benefits to be realised from FY18.  Last, we have continued to strengthen our supplier partnerships to enhance quality, innovation, sustainability and profitability to help offset exchange rates.  

Moving on to new growth initiatives, and I would like here to particularly talk about international.  For the first time we exhibited this year at ISPO the outdoor and sports trade show in Germany and travelled to Europe to engage with a certain number of European outdoor retailers.  The story of our brand, the distinctiveness of our products and our success story in Australasia were well received.  Some feedback we got from prospective customers is that our products offer good balance between functionality and style.  The first stage in this process was to establish relationships with selected key European retail partners.  I’m pleased to say that we are currently finalising agreements with a couple of strategic retailers in the UK and Germany to run trials in their stores for European winter 2017.  Back to Reuben.  

Reuben Casey: Thanks Xavier.  I’m just going to say a few words about sustainability on slide 26.  Something we don’t really talk about enough is our commitment to sustainability and it’s something that’s inherently part of our company values, is very important to our customers and to our employees.  Last November, we were honoured to receive a Large Business Sustainability Leaders award in Australia, awarded by the Banksia Foundation.  And we’ve set ourselves some challenging goals to achieve around re-using plastic bottles in our products, zero waste to landfill, 100% use of sustainable cotton, and reductions in carbon emissions.  

These are all challenges that involve a truly cross-functional effort by everyone in the company.  We also remain committed to progressing to full Fair Labour Association accreditation, a Bluesign membership, minimising our carbon footprint, engaging with the community and investing in our team’s training and development.  For Kathmandu, we see this as not just window dressing or a box ticking exercise but it embodies who we are and how we operate and what we believe is the right thing to do.  If you have not had the chance, I would encourage you all to read our 2016 Sustainability Report available on our investor website for more insight. 

Xavier Simonet: Last slide of the presentation, slide 28, Outlook.  In the industry, the outdoor industry is and will remain immensely competitive.  At Kathmandu, we believe with passion that, more than just a retailer, Kathmandu is a great brand.  Our own in-house product design team based in Christchurch, designs great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products.  We are up for the challenge to compete, not only in Australia and New Zealand, but also internationally.  

The international wholesale opportunities are developing and we’re really starting a journey that’s going to take some time but the recent trip to Europe have given us confidence that both our brand and products have strong relevance, offer distinctiveness, and can have credibility internationally.  We also remain committed to continuous improvements, and in the second half of FY17, we refocus on same store sales growth, particularly in Australia; strengthening the Kathmandu brand and customer engagement; connecting with customers through social media and digital channels; cost control, and efficiencies.  

That is all from me.  Thank you very much for joining the conference call this morning and we’re going to take a few questions.  

Operator: Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 on your telephone keypad.  If you’re on a speaker phone, please make sure you turn off your mute function so your signal can reach our equipment.  Once again, for questions at this time, please press *1 now.  And we do have a question from Chelsea Leadbetter from Forsyth Barr.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Thanks Moderator and morning, guys.  If I can just start with - are you there?  Can you hear me? 

Xavier Simonet:  Yes, good morning.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay, morning guys.  Just start with outlook and I appreciate it’s far too early ahead of winter to give any particular guidance but you did comment on improved momentum in the second quarter.  Have you seen that continue since balance date? 

Reuben Casey: We’re not going to comment on trading since balance date, simply because the time of our autumn promotion is different to last year so it’s really difficult to give an accurate picture of that.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  Well, then I guess I’ll ask another sort of question along the same lines.  The backdrop that you’re seeing in the competitive landscape in both Aussie and New Zealand, have you seen any meaningful changes over the last six months or going forward with respect to your competitors? 

Reuben Casey: I might comment that our outlook is constantly changing and that’s really what we’re seeing.  In Australia, we’ve seen adventure mega store open a few stores, that have the Colombia license, and Macpac have opened a few stores. There’s not been a whole lot of change in New Zealand and Mountain Design are opening a few stores in regional centres.  Rays have gone through kind of contraction and reformatting, so it’s constantly changing.  

Xavier Simonet: And all the brands and retailers are making efforts for continuous improvements – to make continuous improvements as well.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay, thank you.  And just, you’ve touched quite a bit on the Australian rent profile and what you’ve seen in that market in particular.  Does that change your thinking on the store footprint?  I appreciate you haven’t changed your target but on the store footprint size or any other sort of ways to offset that rent pressure that you’re kind of seeing in that Australian market in particular? 

Xavier Simonet: I think it’s about finding a balance between these national stores where we can display all our products, particularly our camping and our tents.  And shopping centres is where the traffic is.  So it’s really about finding the balance.  It’s difficult and we challenge ourselves all the time but we certainly see shopping centres as driving traffic.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  So we shouldn’t expect any material change on how you’re approaching the store footprint at this point in time?  

Reuben Casey: Not at this point, no.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: And just last question, you’ve talked a bit about some of the ranging trials that you’ve been doing through the last six to 12 months, can you give us any sort of hard financial examples of what you’ve actually seen as a result i.e. EBIT uplift per store or per square metre or anything like that? 

Xavier Simonet: Well, we don’t want to share too much.  We’ve really worked on improving sales and gross profit densities per square metre.  It’s about assortment and range to space allocation. 

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  So you can’t give us any hard sort of ideas of is it double digit or is it more material than sort of that? 

Xavier Simonet:  It’s material.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  

Reuben Casey: Yeah, we can’t do that, I’m sorry.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  That’s all for me for now.  Thank you.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thanks.  

Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1.  Our next question will come from John Stavliotis with Morgan Stanley.  

Xavier Simonet:  Morning, John.  

John Stavliotis: Morning.  Just a question on - you talk a bit about this European opportunity obviously being in discussions.  What does the partnership look like in terms of the contract and how it would be structured? 

Xavier Simonet: Yeah, I can’t comment yet.  We’re in the process of finalising agreements and it is just too early.  We went to Europe in November, went back to Europe for ISPO in February and we’ve been engaging with potential partners since then and finalising those agreements.  So it’s just a bit too early to confirm.  Sorry, John.  

John Stavliotis: It’s all right.  

Xavier Simonet: It’s also [inaudible].   

John Stavliotis: Sorry? 

Xavier Simonet: It is wholesale [inaudible].  

John Stavliotis: And negotiations you’re having now, are they about that kind of initial trials and stuff or is that actually about forming a kind of a full range for them?  Or is it too early to talk about that as well?  

Xavier Simonet:  Yeah, I can’t comment because we’re in the middle of discussions with those partners.

John Stavliotis: Yes, so.  Just on a different note, cost out opportunities, clearly have some good cost leverage in this half, is there any other sort of initiatives that you can sort of see cost reductions in the next six to twelve months?   

Reuben Casey: We don’t see significant opportunities for any cost outs, going forward.  

John Stavliotis: Okay.  And last question from me.  You mentioned something about more promotional or more promotional days or more discounting during the half, can you just give a bit more detail on that?  What drove that and what we should expect going forward? 

Reuben Casey: Yeah, I don’t recall actually saying that, John.  

John Stavliotis: On gross margin – you split out movement on the gross margin between currency and discounting.  

Reuben Casey: Yeah, half a percentage point is really the FX kind of headwind that we couldn’t cover.  Half a percentage point was down to more clearance than we had generally last year. We ended the year with slightly more clearance than was probably optimal and then that meant we had a slightly higher mix of clearance sales, particularly in the first quarter.  And then there’s 0.2% which is really due to timing of sales so Christmas was a bit of slow starter but then once it came, it came quite late but it’s just had a small impact on our margin as well.  

John Stavliotis: Okay.  

Reuben Casey: The promotional days, the promotional days for the half is identical to last year in terms of the number of days we were on promotion, just the timing is different, that’s all.  

John Stavliotis: Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you.  

Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 now.  And once again that is a final reminder for questions at this time, press *1.  And I show we have no further questions at this time.  

Reuben Casey: Thank you.  

Operator: We’ll turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you very much for joining the conference call.  Have a good morning.  

Operator: That does conclude our conference at this time.  Thank you for your participation.  You may now disconnect.

    Kiwi Property portfolio value increases to $3 billion
    9:01am,  3 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Kiwi Property today reported a net increase of approximately $38 million (+1.3%) in the value of its portfolio of shopping centres and office buildings for the year ended 31 March 2017, with the total portfolio value lifting to $3.0 billion.

Chief Executive, Chris Gudgeon, said: “Kiwi Property’s portfolio has benefited from a general strengthening in investment market conditions with capitalisation rates firming to a record low across the portfolio. New leasing deals and strong sales at our key retail centres have assisted value growth, albeit our overall gain was moderated by our continued proactive approach to earthquake strengthening which effectively reduced the gain by approximately $22 million.”

The weighted average capitalisation rate for the portfolio firmed 21 basis points to 6.4% and the valuations indicate that, overall, the portfolio is marginally under-rented by 0.5%.

The March 2017 property valuations were determined by independent valuers and will be confirmed in the Company’s audited financial results for the year to 31 March 2017, to be announced on 22 May 2017.

RETAIL PORTFOLIO
 
The value of the retail portfolio increased to $2.0 billion and its weighted average capitalisation rate firmed 17 basis points to 6.52%. This represented a net value gain (after allowing for capital expenditure and IFRS adjustments) of approximately $8 million (+0.4%). 

Sylvia Park, the Company’s flagship asset, increased in value by $11 million (+1.5%) to $755 million. On completion of the office and dining lane developments now underway (requiring further expenditure of $75 million in remaining development costs), the value of Sylvia Park is projected to increase to $840 million. 
 

OFFICE PORTFOLIO

The net value gain for the office portfolio was approximately $22 million (+2.5%) with the portfolio value increasing to $879 million and the weighted average capitalisation rate firming 31 basis points to 6.13%.

Auckland office buildings provided a net value gain of $23 million, with capitalisation rates for both Vero Centre and ASB North Wharf firming to 5.75%. The increase in value of the Vero Centre is assisted by limited vacancy in the Prime-grade sector and higher market rents.

In Wellington, Kiwi Property’s core government precinct buildings, The Aurora Centre and 44 The Terrace, produced a combined $4 million of value uplift. The value of the Majestic Centre increased to $119.4 million but a net value loss of $5 million was recorded after allowing for capital expenditure on the seismic upgrade programme which completed in January.

The valuation summary as at 31 March 2017 has been provided to NZX.

    Strategic land acquisition for future town centre
    8:57am,  7 Apr 2017 | ASSET
  

  Kiwi Property is pleased to advise that it has acquired land, and has secured agreements to acquire further land, in Drury, South Auckland, as a strategic long-term holding to capitalise on Auckland’s continuing population growth.

The three ‘greenfield’ sites, together comprising approximately 51.3 hectares of land, are located in Drury adjacent to the junction of the Southern Motorway, Great South Road and the North Island main trunk railway line, approximately 35 kilometres south of Auckland’s CBD.
  
Chris Gudgeon, Chief Executive, said: “This landholding reinforces our commitment to be part of Auckland’s future growth.”

“Our vision is to develop a town centre, to complement the existing Drury town centre, which would be staged over the next 20 years to coincide with predicted population growth, household formation and employment growth in South Auckland,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“We will work with Auckland Council and infrastructure providers to secure a town centre zoning providing for commercial and retail uses integrated with high, medium and low density housing – all within walking distance of an integrated public transport node.”

The acquisition price for two of the land parcels, totalling 42.7 hectares [NOTE 1], is $39.8 million.  The third land parcel of 8.6 hectares, has been secured via a right of first refusal, with the purchase price to be determined with reference to the market when the right is exercised.

NOTE 1: Overseas Investment Office approval is required in relation to the acquisition of 30.6 hectares.
  
“This is an exciting opportunity for Kiwi Property.  Intensification at key transport nodes and master-planned town centre developments are going to be a big part of our future under the Auckland Unitary Plan,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Drury is already a highly accessible location, at the junction of the Southern Motorway, Great South Road and the North Island main trunk railway line.”

“Transport links to this area are only going to get better with Auckland Transport’s plans for the construction of the Mill Road southern arterial route, electrification of rail through to Pukekohe and the opportunity to construct a railway station adjacent to the town centre.”

The land’s current zoning is ‘Future Urban’ under the Auckland Unitary Plan.

Kiwi Property’s plans for the amalgamated sites will be complementary to an adjacent development being planned by Stevenson Group.
 
“At over 300 hectares in size, the Drury South enterprise district is intended to provide world-class facilities for logistics, manufacturing and commercial operations, together with community facilities and housing,” said Mr Gudgeon.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    10:06am, 13 Apr 2017 | WAV/RULE
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK)
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants MCK a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its Ordinary Shares for a period of twelve months from 13 April 2017 to allow MCK to have fewer than 25% of the Ordinary Shares held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding.
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.MCK clearly and prominently discloses the waiver, its conditions, and the implications in its half-year and annual reports; 
b.MCK consistently monitors the total number of Members of the Public holding Ordinary Shares and the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding and provides NZXR with quarterly updates with this information from the date the waiver is granted during the period of the waiver, such updates to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter; and 
c.MCK notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the total number of Members of the Public holding Ordinary Shares, and/or the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rules to which this decision relates are set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
5.Capitalised terms that are not defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.
Reasons
6.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, MCK has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.based on the current shareholding, spread and the level of trading over the previous year, NZXR is satisfied that MCK will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
c.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, MCK would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares; 
d.holders of the Ordinary Shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, MCK submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
e.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the Ordinary Shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the Ordinary Shares, of this waiver and its implications for the Ordinary Shares;
f.the condition contained in paragraph 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in MCK’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
g.the waiver is granted for a period of 12 months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the Ordinary Shares in 12 months’ time if MCK considers a waiver is still required; and
h.there is precedent for this decision.  
 
Appendix One
1.Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is a Listed Issuer with Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board. 
2.In 2015, MCK was granted a waiver from the requirement in Rule 5.2.3 to have fewer than 25% of its Ordinary Shares held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding (2015 Waiver). 
3.The 2015 Waiver was required as one of the substantial shareholders of MCK’s Ordinary Shares, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (Aberdeen), could no longer be considered a Member of the Public under the Rules on the basis that Aberdeen held more than 10% of the Ordinary Shares in MCK. As at 14 January 2017 Aberdeen holds 10.7% of the Ordinary Shares on Issue.
4.In 2016 a further Waiver was granted for a period of 12 months, expiring on April 14 2017. 
5.As at 14 January 2017, a total of 1427 Members of the Public held 19.1% of the Ordinary Shares on issue, with approximately 10 custodians and nominees holding Ordinary Shares. 
6.MCK has applied for a further Waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of the Ordinary Shares for 12 months from 13 April 2017. 
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities
5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    NPT Shareholder Update
    1:05pm, 13 Apr 2017 | S/HOLDER
  

  13 April 2017

Dear NPT Shareholder,

RE: Support for Kiwi Property Proposal from New Zealand Shareholders’ Association

Further to our correspondence regarding the Kiwi Property proposal before the company, we recently received a letter from the New Zealand Shareholder’s Association (NZSA) which we think will be of interest to all NPT shareholders.

The NZSA fulfils a valuable role in promoting the interests of shareholders in NZX listed companies. It is a member-based organisation that exists to hold companies to high standards of shareholder engagement. As such, it is a genuinely independent body.

In the attached letter to its members, the NZSA provides a very good analysis of all aspects of the Kiwi Property proposal – including a candid assessment of what it sees as being the pros and cons of various scenarios for NPT.  

After evaluating the proposal, and seeking the views of various stakeholders, the NZSA has indicated that it will vote any undirected proxies it receives in support of the Kiwi Property proposal.

Mr Midgley (Chief Executive of NZSA) noted that the NZSA was happy to accept proxies from any shareholders whether or not they were members of the Shareholders Association. He also said that shareholders that have already voted can always change their minds and submit a new vote.

The NZSA letter is attached for your information.   

The NZSA letter reinforces the NPT Board’s own view - which is supported by advice received by the NPT Board and feedback from other institutional investors - that the Kiwi Property proposal is in the best interests of NPT shareholders.  

We take this opportunity to remind all shareholders again how important it is that you exercise your right to vote in support of the future you want to see for NPT.

As is their right, two major shareholders have publicly expressed their opposition to the Kiwi Property proposal. One of these parties, Augusta Capital, has significantly increased its shareholding in NPT from 9.3% to 18.8% in the last week.  Based on Augusta’s proposal submitted to the NPT Board in October last year (which was formally withdrawn in March this year), the NPT Board expects Augusta’s ultimate goal is to be appointed as the external manager of NPT.

The special meeting is being held in Auckland at 11.00 a.m. on 21 April 2017. If you are unable to attend, we strongly urge you to submit your proxy form.  The Chairman of the NPT Board is willing to act as your proxy, as is the NZSA. You must have your proxy to our Registrar, Link Market Services, no later than 11:00 am on 19 April 2017, hence we ask for your urgent attention to this matter

Kind regards
 
Tony Sewell
Chairman 
NPT Limited

    Quarterly Activities Report

  ANNOUNCEMENT BY NEW TALISMAN GOLD MINES LIMITED [ASX, NZSX: NTL]

FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

Quarterly Activities Report to 31 December 2016

New Talisman Gold Mines Limited is pleased to present the quarterly report on activities for the period ended 31 December 2016 

HIGHLIGHTS

• Charbel Nader appointed as Chairman
• Talisman Prefeasibility updated
• Talisman Deeps analysis identifies mineralised extensions
• Rahu targeting work commenced

Corporate

As announced in the Half yearly report released in December the company has recently appointed 2 new Directors with Mr Charbel Nader being appointed as Chairman during the period and Mr Murray McKee stepping down as Chairman. 

TALISMAN GOLD PROJECT (100%) – Hauraki District, NZ
During the quarter to December 2016 the company continued to make progress towards initiating works at the Talisman Mine. Having received approval in principle for the company’s proposals for managing traffic safety on the mine road, and having completed the preliminary roadway design, the focus remains on agreeing the final road design parameters with local council. 

The company continues to engage with the council and other stakeholders to achieve a design that reflects the needs of all road users and acknowledges that, while progress is not as rapid as initially hoped, it is necessary to follow a continuous review process in order to ensure the safety of all road users when operations commence. Once complete the company will be able to issue tender documents for the full scope of works including earthworks and traffic control requirements.

Risk assessment of the projects preliminary electrical reticulation system design has been completed and suitable controls to manage those risks have been identified. Those controls have been documented in the hazard management plans and are now being incorporated into the final system design. 

Work on the update of the pre-feasibility study continues with current efforts centred on an update of the resource estimate utilising geochemical and structural information obtained from the historical database. This is being run in parallel with the Talisman Deeps project which is discussed in the next section. 

Talisman Deeps Project

The Talisman Deeps project has progressed well during the quarter. This project was commissioned with the objective of identifying extensions to the existing indicated and inferred mineral resources through analysis and modelling of the historical database acquired by the company in 2015. The first stage of this project will involve merging all existing data into one comprehensive database and compiling the most advanced three dimensional model of the mines geology and historical workings ever produced.
 
Data verification of the historic geochemical sampling database is complete, the most important historical plans have been digitally scanned and digitising of the historic workings and structural geology is now well underway.

Preliminary results previously reported suggest sizeable blocks of unmined ground remain between the 10 and 16 Levels in sections of the Maria Vein referred to as the Talisman and Bonanza Shoots.

The figure below shows the existing resource block in the Dubbo Shoot and gold equivalent grades in grams per tonne from channel samples collected circa 1919 in the old workings in the Talisman and Bonanza Shoots.

Mined out blocks are not shown as their locations and dimensions are still being evaluated from historic mine plans. 
The quality control and assurance procedures in place at the time that the samples were taken cannot be verified at this stage and therefore the data cannot currently be used to generate mineral resource or reserve estimates that will comply with the requirements of the JORC code 2012 but do constitute an Exploration Target as defined in the 2012 JORC Code. The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. 

Rahu

During the quarter, Newcrest, the manager of exploration activities at the Rahu project has undertaken geological studies utilising data provided to it by NTL to define deep drill targets. These studies included a re-evaluation of Rahu drill core using hyperspectral analysis and chemical analysis to determine zonal patterning of hydrothermal alteration mineralogy and geochemistry indicative of gold mineralisation at depth.

Amer

During the period NTL met with representatives of Amer and while the groups have continued to express an interest  in working together; however agreement on material matters such as valuation, and asset composition, are not at this stage in a form capable of being considered by the Company and its Shareholders. Both parties have agreed to continue to investigate the opportunity.

Tenements 

The interest in Mining Tenements Held by New Talisman Gold Mines (and its subsiduaries) at the end of the quarter and related percentage of ownership.

Murray has been a board member for over 20 years and as Chairman has guided the board through a difficult time for mining companies in general to where the company stands today in a strong position both financially and commercially to commence operations at Talisman.  Murray has advised he will stay on the board as independent director. 

The Board has appointed Charbel Nader as Chairman of the board. Charbel brings a wealth of commercial experience to the company in its next stage of development. Charbel’s history in assisting smaller companies navigate large scale and complex commercial situations to deliver favourable outcomes to shareholders will be invaluable to NTL as enters an exciting new period in its development. 

Charbel Nader stated “In taking over from Murray I am very conscious of the exemplary leadership that he has provided through a very difficult time for the industry and the company. I am pleased that his skill and wisdom will continue to be available to me and the company. I look forward to working with the first rate management team and the board now assembled at NTL to advance the Talisman project and NTL’s other assets in a sustainable manner that is respectful of their environment and that delivers broader benefits to the community. We as a board are conscious of the trust placed in NTL by our shareholders and are committed to making the most of the company’s enviable asset base. Whilst there remains some challenges there has never been more reason to be optimistic about NTL’s future. ”

Appointment of Company Secretary

The Board also welcomes Jane Bell as Company Secretary replacing Matthew Hill as interim company secretary.

    Prospective Operational and Capital Restructure
    5:23pm, 15 Nov 2016 | GENERAL
  

  15 November 2016

BY E-MAIL: announce@nzx.com

NZX Limited
Wellington

PROSPECTIVE OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL RESTRUCTURE 
NZF Group Limited (""NZF"") advises that:
Entry into conditional Implementation Deed
NZF has today entered into a conditional Implementation Deed with Blackwell Global Group Limited (“Blackwell”), which company is associated with Kaw Sing Chai, who earlier in the year subscribed for new shares in NZF pursuant to a private placement. 
The purpose of the Implementation Deed is to regulate the manner in which NZF and Blackwell propose to implement an operational and capital restructure of the Company, subject to the prior approval of the Company’s shareholders.

Objectives of the Capital and Operational Restructure of NZF (“Restructure”)

The principal objectives of the Restructure are to reorganise the capital and organisational structure of NZF as follows:
1. The issue of 313,872,866 new ordinary fully paid shares by NZF to Blackwell and other investors introduced by Blackwell (and/or their respective nominees). The issue price per new share shall be $0.008 per share. The aggregate subscription price will be $2,510,982.93; 
2. The issue of up to 3,000,000 convertible notes (“Notes”) by NZF to Blackwell and/or its nominee(s). The Notes shall have an aggregate face value of $3,000,000. The Notes shall accrue interest and shall be convertible into ordinary shares in NZF, at the option of the Noteholder, at a conversion price of $0.008 per share;
3. The appointment of new Directors to the board of directors of NZF (""Board"") post completion of the Restructure;

4. The introduction of additional human resources into NZF to fulfil the executive roles required to achieve the implementation of the Restructure, in addition to the resource already retained by NZF;

5. The launch of a new finance company operation;

6. The launch of a new derivative trading operation, in conjunction with the purchase of certain derivative trading assets from Blackwell;

7. The obtaining of all requisite FMA and statutory licences and registrations required in connection with the Restructure and by NZF to undertake the Finance Company Operations and the Derivative Trading Operations;

8. The issue of up to $6,000,000 of secured bonds (“Bonds”) to Blackwell and/or third party investors introduced by Blackwell to assist in funding the growth of the Company’s finance company operations, and the acquisition of the Derivative Business Assets by NZF.

Conditions 
Completion of the Restructure is subject to, and conditional upon, (amongst other matters) the satisfaction of the necessary regulatory approvals and sign offs, and the Shareholders of NZF approving all of the resolutions required to be passed to implement the Restructure. 
The Board anticipates that the Special Meeting of Shareholders to consider the Restructure will be held during the course of February 2017, and should the Shareholders approve the Restructure, the Restructure will complete shortly thereafter.

The NZF Board recommends that NZF shareholders should not undertake any action in respect of their shares that they hold until such time as NZF is able to provide those shareholders will a full suite of information pertaining to the Restructure, including the independent reports

Agreement with Inland Revenue Department and Update on the Capital and Operational Restructure of NZF

GST Issue
The Company has previously advised that: 
- the Inland Revenue Department was reviewing the Company’s GST returns for the period 1 April 2013 onwards in relation to the Company’s ability to claim GST on expenses incurred; and

Capital and Operational Restructure
Further to our announcement on 15 November 2016 advising that NZF had entered into a conditional Implementation Deed with Blackwell Global Group Limited (“Blackwell”), the Company advises that:

- the drafting of the Notice of Meeting, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Independent Advisers Report and Appraisal Report are well advanced;

- it is hoped to have the aforementioned documentation forwarded to the NZX and to the Takeovers Panel for their review during the course of the next week;

- it is anticipated that a special meeting of shareholders will be called to approve the capital and operational restructure during the course of April or May.

    NPT Shareholder Update - Shareholder Meeting
    10:30am, 12 Apr 2017 | S/HOLDER
  

  12 April 2017

Dear Shareholder,

By now you should have received your copy of the Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held in Auckland on 21st April 2017.

There has been a lot of commentary in the media lately; therefore I am writing this letter so that you have a first-hand view of what your Board is recommending and why.

The resolutions being put forward at the special meeting are critical to the future of NPT Limited and your investment in the Company.

In essence, the resolutions will decide firstly, and very importantly, if you want your Company governed by the current Board of Carol Campbell, Jim Sherwin and myself, or governed by new directors who have been put forward by Augusta Capital including the Chair of Augusta Capital, Paul Duffy.

Your current Board has addressed the issues facing NPT, being its low share price relative to the net tangible value of its assets (NTA) and its sub optimal size, $170 million of assets.

The Board proposed by Augusta has not put forward its strategy for the Company. If the resolutions proposed by Augusta are passed, the directors nominated by Augusta would have the authority to take NPT in any direction they choose, including the ability to grant Augusta a contract to manage the Company and its assets if they wished.

It is this uncertainty around the intentions of an Augusta promoted Board that leads me to ask you to consider this carefully as our Board considers that voting for the three Augusta nominees is not in the best interests of shareholders. This will require a vote NO to Resolutions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The second major issue is the future of NPT and your investment in it. Clearly, NPT is too small to continue as a sustainable operation. Your Board has addressed this by seeking proposals from parties that will grow the Company; provide first class management; and drive for a sustainable future for your Company.

The Board has received a high quality proposal from Kiwi Property Group that will afford NPT the benefits of scale through a single transaction, set the Company on a path of sustainable growth and add significantly to the Company’s depth of management.

 
The nature of the management contract sets a new standard in the New Zealand listed property market. It can be cancelled by NPT without cause after 5 years with shareholder approval, with a market based fee to be paid in that event. The management contract could only be sold by Kiwi to a third party if NPT provides its written consent to that sale. Kiwi brings a team of 170 to assist us in managing your Company.

We want to emphasise - this is not a takeover by Kiwi. Your Board will continue to govern NPT on your behalf and NPT will still own its portfolio of properties including those being purchased from Kiwi.

The Board has had advice from Northington Partners who assessed all proposals submitted to the Board. The Kiwi Proposal was well ahead of all other proposals. It has also received support from independent brokers.

The Kiwi proposal is definite and capable of execution now versus any proposal Augusta may wish to develop and put forward. The Kiwi proposal offers certainty for NPT’s future; Augusta has not put forward any plan.

On this basis, the Board recommends that you vote YES for Resolution 1.

The future of your Company is in your hands. It is clear to everyone that our retail investors will control the outcome of the vote. I ask you to take this matter very seriously and to exercise your vote.

This can be done by following the voting procedure at the special meeting or by appointing a proxy.  If you have already voted and wish to change your vote you can contact Link Market Services by phone on +64 9 375 5998 or by email at enquiries@linkmarketservices.co.nz.

The manager of one of our major institutional investors, ANZ Investments, has written a very informative article about the issues NPT faces, I have attached this article for your information.

Your Board is committed to putting in place the strategy it has developed to grow your wealth as shareholders

Kind regards
 
Tony Sewell
Chairman 
NPT Limited

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Healthcare Partners Partial Takeover Offer Fails
    8:30am,  6 Mar 2017 | TAKEOVER
  

  Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX:ABA) advises that the hostile partial takeover attempt by dissident shareholder Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves, has failed after closing with minimal acceptances and materially short of its 50.01% condition.

On expiry of its partial takeover offer at 5pm on 3 March 2017, Healthcare Partners had publicly disclosed acceptances in respect of 2.35% of shares in Abano on issue, sufficient to take its holding to 21.37%, well short of its condition of 50.01%. 

As the offer has failed, Healthcare Partners will not take up any shares from shareholders who accepted the offer. This means that Healthcare Partners’ shareholding remains at 19.02%, and any shareholders who accepted the offer retain ownership of their shares.  

Abano has incurred significant external costs, which it considers were properly incurred in responding to the partial takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, these costs are to be reimbursed by Healthcare Partners. As at today’s date, over $377,000 is still outstanding and overdue from Healthcare Partners, with final costs still to be charged.  The Abano Board does not believe it is reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to be funding these ongoing costs for Healthcare Partners and the Board will continue to seek to ensure this is paid promptly and without further delay so as not to further disadvantage Abano’s shareholders. 

Abano’s Board and management are pleased that the distraction of this hostile bid has now ended and they remain focused on continuing to grow the company and delivering value to all shareholders.

ENDS

    Market Update and Director Resignation

  TRS:   Market Update and Director Resignation

Following completion of the HuaHan International Holdings (Hong Kong) Co Ltd (“HuaHan”) transactions in 2016; TRS Investments Limited (“TRS”) wishes to update the market on developments with its forward business intentions.

TRS has, in consultation with HuaHan investigated potential property transactions in New Zealand since their investment in TRS. The investigated transactions have not however been pursued. The nature of these intended transactions was consistent with the nature of transactions disclosed in the shareholder documentation circulated at the time of HuaHan’s investment in TRS.

HuaHan has now advised that it no longer wishes to pursue these types of transactions in New Zealand with TRS. HuaHan’s nominee to the TRS Board, Hao Sun, has accordingly resigned with immediate effect.

However with assistance from HuaHan, TRS has been introduced to a Chinese company with an established business and are interested in reverse listing that business into TRS. The directors need to undertake further due diligence but believe the opportunity appears very good. TRS is looking to finalise and agree a term sheet for the transaction and will then be in a position to update the market more fully.

In light of the change of direction and HuaHan’s intentions, TRS has not received funds from a requested drawdown from the HuaHan Working Capital Facility (as was approved by shareholders last year). TRS relies on this facility for working capital and accordingly this has placed cashflow pressure on TRS. TRS will continue working with HuaHan in this respect but notes that any new transaction will likely involve upfront payments which would improve TRS’ cash position.

    RPS  SPP Announcement
    9:49am, 17 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Market Release
17 March 2017

AFT Redeemable Preference Share Issue and Proposed Share Purchase Plan
AFT Pharmaceuticals Limited (NZX: AFT, ASX: AFP) today confirms a Redeemable Share Issue of approximately NZ$9.1m to CRG and the Atkinson Family Trust. The Issue Price of the Redeemable Shares is NZ$2.74, which is equal to the volume weighted average price of AFT’s ordinary shares on the NZX over the last five business days.  
The proceeds from the Redeemable Shares will provide additional balance sheet capacity enabling AFT to pursue its current and planned R&amp;D programme, as well as taking advantage of the codeine rescheduling decision in its key Australian market.
Dr Hartley Atkinson, CEO of AFT, says that the share issue is fundamentally about fuelling international growth. “Through our R&amp;D and regulatory work we have created a number of potentially global opportunities for our patented products. This is really about making sure we take full advantage of the opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company right across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.”
Development of key innovative products is proceeding well with filing of Maxigesic tablets in the US achieved in February 2017. The pivotal clinical study for the intravenous (IV) Maxigesic formulation is proceeding ahead of expectations which will in turn accelerate the clinical trials expenditure.
Six new dose forms of Maxigesic are also currently under development which is more than the four originally envisaged. Additional filings are also planned for this year.
Clinical studies have also commenced for AFT’s patented NasoSURF drug delivery device. Meetings have been scheduled for this year with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to finalise an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the first targeted indication. Further indications will follow, but only after the first NasoSURF development is completed or at least well underway.
Similarly a further IND application with the FDA is planned this year for Pascomer - a novel treatment applied to the skin to treat certain serious skin conditions - rounding out a busy R&amp;D programme.
“AFT does have an extensive R&amp;D program and this capital raise will help us complete the key stages which will allow further licensing agreements to be made. This will then be followed by product registrations and the all-important sales,” said Dr Atkinson.
In addition to the Redeemable Share Issue, AFT intends to make an offer of ordinary shares to eligible shareholders through a Share Purchase Plan (SPP). The SPP is expected to give each eligible shareholder of AFT an opportunity to subscribe for at least NZ$15,000 of shares. The final terms of the SPP are expected to be announced in more detail in late May 2017 when the FY2017 financial results are released.
“This will give our retail shareholders an opportunity to also participate in this small capital raise,” said AFT Chairman, David Flacks.
AFT has released a Business Update presentation associated with this market release.
Summary of the Terms of the Redeemable Shares
• Each Redeemable Share is entitled to a dividend of 9.4% per annum calculated on the Issue Price of that Redeemable Share. AFT may elect at its discretion whether or not to pay dividends and may elect to pay part of a dividend on a dividend payment date. If any dividends are not paid they will accumulate on a compounding basis.
• Redeemable Shares do not carry any right to vote except at meetings of an “interest group” of holders of Redeemable Shares.
• Redeemable Shares may be redeemed at the option of AFT at any time two years or more after issue. On redemption, AFT would pay the Issue Price plus dividends accrued to the date of redemption. 
• After three years from issue, the Redeemable Shares may be converted to ordinary shares at the option of the holder in multiples of 100,000. The holder would receive one ordinary share for every Redeemable Share held and a number of ordinary shares calculated by dividing the amount of any accumulated dividends by the Issue Price.
• Optional conversion events arise if:
- AFT raises any equity capital of NZ$20m or more in a transaction or series of transactions
- The price of ordinary shares on the NZX exceeds the Issue Price by 20% or more, or ordinary shares are issued by AFT at a premium of 20% or more to the Issue Price
- AFT issues equity interests (or debt securities or similar equity or convertible securities) in AFT in one or a series of related transactions, the principal purpose of which is to raise capital, and which are listed on any exchange in the US, the EU or the UK
- A takeover, amalgamation or scheme of arrangement in respect of AFT occurs 
- Following the issue date a person other than the trustees of the Atkinson Family Trust, either alone or together with its associates, acquires directly or indirectly beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the voting rights in AFT
- AFT offers or takes steps to offer shares which rank in respect of dividends and in a liquidation in priority to the Redeemable Shares
- AFT enters into any transaction or series of linked or related transactions to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets of AFT or any subsidiary of AFT which would either change the essential nature of the business, in respect of which the gross value is in excess of 50% of the average market capitalisation, or which is a major transaction 
- A resolution of shareholders to liquidate the company is proposed or an application is made to the High Court for the liquidation of AFT in circumstances where AFT is solvent
• No sale or transfer of the ordinary shares issued (for any accrued dividends or in connection with a capital change event) shall take place within a 12 month period after the issue of those ordinary shares unless off-market to certain qualified investors and the buyer provides an equivalent covenant to AFT.
• In a liquidation of AFT, each holder of Redeemable Shares is entitled to receive, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares or any other shares in AFT that by their terms are expressed to rank behind the Redeemable Shares, the redeemable share amount (being the Issue Price plus any accrued dividend) in respect of each Redeemable Share.
• Redeemable Shares will not be quoted on the NZX Main Board or any other exchange.
• The Redeemable Shares will be issued and settled on 24 March 2017.

    AIA - Wholesale floating rate note issue
    3:51pm,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Market Release 6 April 2017

Wholesale floating rate note issue

Auckland Airport has today completed an issue of $150 million of floating rate notes to institutional investors which will be used to partially refinance its maturing $150 million floating rate note on 11 April 2017.

Phil Neutze, Auckland Airport’s chief financial officer, says “Together with the 10.5 year Australian Medium Term Note issue in March 2017 and the November 2016 seven year domestic bond issue, this three year floating rate note supports Auckland Airport’s well-diversified portfolio, which is spread across a range of New Zealand and offshore markets and tenors.”

The floating rate notes have a term of three years and a margin of 75 basis points over BKBM. The offer was made to New Zealand and offshore institutions with ANZ and CBA acting as joint lead managers on the issue.

    Loan Asset Sale - Update
    2:51pm,  5 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  5 April 2017 

 
 
On 5 March 2013 Allied Farmers Limited (Allied Farmers, NZX: ALF) advised that it had entered into an agreement to sell various loan assets with nil book value to a confidential third party (“Loan Asset Sale”). At that time ALF advised that the consideration for the Loan Asset Sale resulted in an immediate net payment to ALF of $100,000 and possibly up to a further $500,000 dependent on outcomes unknown at that time. 
 
ALF advises that the Loan Asset Sale was the assignment by its wholly owned subsidiary, Allied Farmers Investments Limited, of loan assets to SPF No.10 Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of litigation funder LPF Group Limited.  SPF No.10 Limited is providing litigation funding to Robert Walker, the liquidator of Property Ventures Limited (in Liquidation) (the “Company”) and various of its subsidiaries, in relation to litigation against the Company’s directors and its auditors, for breach of duties owed to the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
If the Company’s litigation is successful, ALF is entitled under the terms of the Deed of Assignment to a proportion of any net proceeds of that litigation (that proportion being confidential).
 
The Liquidator has advised that the case is progressing well and has provided updated guidance on the possible return from that litigation for ALF, based on the current circumstances advised to the Liquidator by its legal team. Highlighting the difficulties of predicting the outcome or the final quantum and the inherently risky nature of litigation, the Liquidator has advised that, if successful, the final quantum will be higher than that predicted in 2013, and accordingly that ALF may be entitled to a substantially greater amount than $500,000. 

ALF does not expect that any return would be received in the current financial year.

Chairman

  16 March 2017
Air New Zealand adopts ASX Foreign Exempt Listing

Air New Zealand today confirmed that it has changed its ASX admission category from ASX Listing to an ASX Foreign Exempt Listing, effective from 17 March 2017.

This means that Air New Zealand will be expected to comply primarily with the Listing Rules of the NZX Main Board (being the rules of its home exchange) and is exempt from complying with most of ASX’s Listing Rules.

Waivers to NZX Listing Rules that are currently relied upon by Air New Zealand are summarised in Appendix 1.

Air New Zealand continues to have a full listing on the NZX Main Board and Air New Zealand shares will continue to be listed on ASX.

Air New Zealand remains committed to best practice in corporate governance, including guidelines of the NZX, ASX and the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority.

Ends.

• Operating statistics table

February market conditions
Air New Zealand carried 1,268,000 passengers during the month of February, an increase of 2.4% compared to the same period last year. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) were 2.0% higher on a capacity (ASKs) increase of 5.3%. Group load factors were down 2.6 percentage points overall to 81.6%.

Short Haul passenger numbers increased 2.2%.  In the Domestic market demand (RPKs) increased by 5.9%, with capacity (ASKs) increasing by 6.4%, due to increased services on Auckland – Queenstown and the main trunk routes, as well as growth on the regional routes resulting from up-gauging to larger aircraft.  Domestic load factor decreased 0.5 percentage points to 83.2%. 

Tasman/Pacific demand (RPKs) decreased 2.2% while capacity (ASKs) increased by 4.1%, due to the up-gauging to larger aircraft on several Pacific Island routes. Load factor on Tasman/Pacific decreased 4.9 percentage points to 78.1%, as the Tasman routes continue to be impacted by additional market capacity compared to the prior year. 

Long Haul passenger numbers increased 3.1% when compared to February last year, with demand (RPKs) up 2.9% and capacity (ASKs) up 5.5%. Load factor on Long Haul routes was 82.8%, down 2.1 percentage points. 

On Americas/UK routes, demand (RPKs) decreased by 0.8%, with capacity (ASKs) decreasing 1.2% due to reduced frequency on the Auckland-Los Angeles route, partially offset by increased services to Houston and Buenos Aires. Load factor increased 0.3 percentage points to 83.3%. 

On Asia/Japan/Singapore routes, demand (RPKs) increased 9.1%, with capacity (ASKs) increasing by 17.2%, reflecting additional frequency on the Shanghai route over the Chinese New Year holiday and the new seasonal service between Auckland and Osaka. Load factor, although still strong at 82.0%, decreased 6.1 percentage points. 

For the financial year to date, Short Haul passenger revenue per ASK (RASK)* decreased 6.6% and Long Haul RASK* decreased 14.6%.  Removing the impact of foreign exchange, Group-wide RASK* decreased 9.0%, and Group-wide yields for the financial year to date decreased 7.3% on the same period last year.  

*  Air New Zealand’s operating statistics will provide Passenger revenue per ASK, or RASK, going forward as a key metric of revenue performance. RASK is defined as passenger revenue for the period divided by the total ASKs for the period; compared to yield which represents the passenger revenue per passenger kilometre flown.

Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific extend alliance

Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific have extended their strategic alliance partnership on services between New Zealand and Hong Kong for a further five years until 2022.

The alliance has delivered a range of benefits to travellers since it was first put in place in January 2013, including greater choice with more frequencies, enhanced connectivity to each carrier’s networks and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits. The extension of the alliance agreement is subject to continuing regulatory approvals.

Cathay Pacific currently operates seasonal double daily services between Auckland and Hong Kong while Air New Zealand operates a daily service on the route. From December 2017, a new seasonal service between Hong Kong and Christchurch will also be introduced under the alliance, operated by Cathay Pacific.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the non-stop service will operate three times per week from 1 December 2017 – 28 February 2018, departing Hong Kong on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays using Airbus A350 aircraft, providing a welcome boost for tourism to Canterbury and the South Island.

Australian and New Zealand airlines to form new aviation industry group

On March 9, Australia and New Zealand’s major airlines announced the establishment of a new industry group to advocate and pursue reform on public policy issues that impact the aviation sector and broader economy in the region.

Professor Graeme Samuel AC, the former Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission whose professional career has spanned senior roles in law, investment banking and public service, will be appointed the independent chair of A4ANZ.

A4ANZ will be governed by a Board made up of a representative from each member airline, in addition to the independent Chair, to oversee the management of the industry group. The CEO will be appointed in coming months.

The group will be funded by its members: Air New Zealand, the Qantas Group, Regional Express Holdings and the Virgin Australia Group. Member airlines are Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Qantas, Regional Express (Rex), Tigerair Australia and Virgin Australia.

    AFT  In-Licenses NovaTears® in Australia and New Zealand

  Market release

21 March 2017

AFT Pharmaceuticals In-Licenses NovaTears in Australia and New Zealand 

AFT Pharmaceuticals (AFT) has completed a licensing agreement with Novaliq, a German specialty pharmaceutical company, to distribute NovaTears in Australia and New Zealand.

NovaTears is an ophthalmic product for the treatment of evaporative dry eye diseases (DEDs) developed by Novaliq and sold across Europe under the brand name EvoTears.

Under the terms of the agreement, Novaliq has granted AFT an exclusive license for the commercialisation of NovaTears across Australasia. In return for these rights, Novaliq will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and royalties on net sales of NovaTears.

“AFT is dedicated to bringing innovative products to market that make a real difference to people’s health,” said Dr Hartley Atkinson, CEO of AFT. 

“The addition of NovaTears to our eye care line will be welcomed by doctors and patients alike. It’s a first-in-class, water-free and preservative-free treatment based on Novaliq’s proprietary EyeSol technology platform. NovaTears supports the lipid layer of the tear film by its ability to quickly spread and be absorbed into the eye. We believe that this feature - combined with its small droplet size - will provide superior benefits to patients with evaporative dry eye disease.”

“This will also help advance our position in the lubricating eye drop market where currently AFT holds the number 4 position in both Australia and New Zealand. This also fits with our strategy of strengthening our market position in categories where we already hold a significant position. Sales from the New Zealand market are expected to be achieved within the FY2018 financial year, and Australian sales the year following,” said Dr Atkinson. 

“Novaliq is delighted to collaborate with AFT, a leading and innovative pharmaceutical company with a strong commitment to eye care,” said Christian Roesky, PhD, CEO of Novaliq.  

“NovaTears provides a highly differentiated and clinically validated treatment option that significantly improves the signs and symptoms of evaporative DED and Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), highly underserved diseases. We are confident that dry eye patients in Australasia will greatly benefit from the use of NovaTears® and our partnership with AFT.”

    Abano Commences Legal Action to Recoup Takeover Costs 
    9:58am, 20 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Abano Healthcare Group Limited (NZX: ABA) advises that it has today commenced legal proceedings in the High Court to seek reimbursement of approximately $566,000 in unpaid costs in relation to the failed hostile partial takeover attempt by Healthcare Partners Holdings Limited and its directors, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves. 

Under Rule 49 of the Takeovers Code, Abano is entitled to recover from Healthcare Partners any expenses properly incurred by Abano in relation to the takeover offer – including in dealing with the two takeover notices which Healthcare Partners gave but were unable to progress due to their non-compliance with the Takeovers Code.  Since the first takeover notice was received in early November 2016, Abano has incurred over $1 million in external costs in relation to Healthcare Partners’ failed bid. 

Despite monthly invoices and several reminders of the overdue  invoices throughout the failed takeover process, which commenced over six months ago, no acceptance of any costs or voluntary payment has been made by Healthcare Partners.

As a result, in January 2017 Abano set-off the interim dividend payable to Healthcare Partners against a portion of the amount outstanding. Following this, Healthcare Partners lodged an unsuccessful complaint with NZX and continues to dispute Abano’s right to have exercised a set-off against the interim dividend in partial recovery of its unpaid costs. 

Despite Abano providing significantly detailed breakdowns of the costs incurred in relation to the takeover, Healthcare Partners continues to dispute every invoice and all costs and has yet to accept that sufficient information has been provided. Abano has therefore been left with no other option but to commence legal proceedings to recoup the outstanding costs. 

The Board believes the failure by Healthcare Partners to accept responsibility for any costs – including those relating to the independent report prepared by Grant Samuel, printing, postage and share registry expenses – is unreasonable and represents a continuation of efforts by Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves to delay and avoid their financial responsibilities under the Takeovers Code. 

Chairman of Abano, Trevor Janes, stated: “The failed partial takeover attempt by Healthcare Partners was time consuming, costly and a distraction for Abano.

“We do not see it as reasonable for Abano and its shareholders to continue to be funding costs properly incurred in relation to Healthcare Partners unsolicited and unsuccessful bid. Healthcare Partners should honour its financial obligations in relation to the failed bid without delay, to avoid disadvantaging Abano and its shareholders any further.”

The Board also notes that in a letter to shareholders during the takeover process, Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves advised that they would “pay the appropriate costs at the appropriate time” and that “the interests of minority shareholders are protected”. Their subsequent actions put these statements in doubt.

In previous unsuccessful takeover attempts by other parties, Abano received reimbursement of costs. This was the third attempt in three and a half years by Peter and Anya Hutson and James Reeves to either gain control of Abano or to force changes to Abano’s Board.  Abano and its shareholders have incurred related costs in excess of $2 million over this period, of which only the properly incurred costs in relation to the latest failed takeover attempt are recoverable.  

Healthcare Partners’ offer lapsed on 3 March 2017, with only minimal acceptances (3.56%), leaving Healthcare Partners’ materially short of its 50.01% minimum acceptance condition.

    Arvida On Track to Deliver Strong FY17 Result
    9:28am, 23 Nov 2016 | HALFYR
  

  - Underlying Profit1 of $9.6 million, up 31% on pcp.
- Underlying earnings per share of 3.46 cents, up 18% on pcp.
- Care occupancy tracks higher to 95%.
- Momentum in unit sales with strong resale gains.
- Outlook – the business is performing well and is on track to deliver strong FY17 result.

Financial Performance

Arvida Group Limited (NZX:ARV) today announced a Net Profit After Tax of $19.4 million for the six months to 30 September 2016. The results include a full period of operations from the Aria villages and a three-month contribution from Lansdowne Park.

For the first six months to 30 September 2016 demand continued to strengthen for Arvida village and care facilities. Total revenue for the period increased to $46.9 million. Care facilities revenue represented over 72% of total revenue. The care facilities’ occupancy rate continued a positive trend and ended the period at over 95% across the Group.

Total operating expenses were $37.2 million and Bill McDonald CEO said “we continue to invest in our people and systems with the view that enduring synergies will be delivered from associated efficiency and productivity improvements.”

The investment properties delivered $14.3 million of gains in fair value from a desktop valuation review completed by CBRE at 30th September 2016.

Underlying Profit of $9.6 million compares to $7.3 million for the prior corresponding six month period. Included within Underlying Profit were $3.9 million of gains, comprising $3.2 million from 87 resales of existing units and $0.7 million from sales of 12 new units. Good momentum was evident in unit sales, with new unit pricing delivering strong resale gains across village stock and contributing to the fair value increase.

Underlying profit per share2 increased 18% on the prior corresponding period to 3.46 cents per share.

Balance Sheet

Total assets grew to $537.2 million, up $76.5 million since the start of the financial year.

External bank debt was $32.4 million at 30 September 2016. A new $80.0 million term bank facility was put in place in October. The facility provides sufficient headroom to fund planned brownfield development and acquisition activity. Arvida remains conservatively geared at 10% on completion of the October acquisitions and capital raising.

Acquisitions and Capital Raising

On 1 July 2016, the acquisition of Lansdowne Park was settled. This village added 93 units and 50 aged care beds. The purchase was funded by $14.6 million of bank debt and $6.0 million of shares issued to vendors. Bare land adjacent to the village has since been acquired with a view to constructing up to 5 villas.

On 20 September 2016, the purchase of Bethlehem Views and Copper Crest Village Estate in Tauranga and Lauriston Park in Cambridge was announced. The villages added, in aggregate, 247 units and 88 care beds plus significant capacity for future brownfield development. The $66.4 million purchase price was satisfied by the issue of $18.5 million shares to vendors, a pro rata renounceable rights offer that successfully raised $41.8 million, with a 90% take-up of entitlements amongst shareholders, and the balance from the new banking facility. Settlement occurred on 3 October 2016 for all three villages.

Commenting on the recent acquisitions, Bill McDonald said “the villages are in prime growth regions where we didn’t have a presence. Market reaction to the acquisitions has been positive with the rights offer receiving strong support from institutions and existing shareholders.”

Integration of Lansdowne Park was successfully accomplished in the period and progress with the integration of the three recent acquisitions is proceeding smoothly.

Further Acquisition

On 23 November 2016, Arvida entered into a conditional agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, to acquire 100% of the shares in Cascades Retirement Resort Limited for $21.2 million. Cascades is located in Hamilton and comprises a recently constructed aged care facility and integrated retirement village. It has 37 retirement units and 74 care beds as well as bare land for future development of over 40 units. The acquisition is immediately accretive to earnings and is to be funded from existing debt facilities with gearing increasing to 14% post completion. Settlement is expected to occur on 30 December 2016.

Development Update

192 units and 33 care beds are consented and currently in varying stages of construction.

Resource consent was obtained in August for the Rhodes on Cashmere development in Christchurch that includes 28 apartments and a combination of 33 care suites and care beds. Resource consent was also obtained for construction of 22 new villas on land acquired adjacent to Oakwoods in Nelson. Enabling works at both Rhodes on Cashmere and Oakwoods started in November.

Construction of 24 new apartments at Aria Bay in Auckland is progressing well and construction of 78 new apartments at Park Lane in Christchurch is due to commence this side of Christmas.

Operations

The investment in our people and operations continues with the view that enduring synergies will be delivered from associated efficiency and productivity improvements.

In recently completed Ministry of Health audits, four of Arvida’s care facilities were distinguished in achieving certification for a 4 year period. Standardised Arvida clinical policies and procedures are now in all villages.

The rollout of a resident management system and introduction of a rostering and time attendance system continues across the Group.

Dividends

The Directors approved a dividend of 1.1 cents per share amounting to $3.7 million for the September quarter. The dividend is partially imputed at 0.4 cents per share. A supplementary dividend of 0.18 cents per share will be paid to non-resident shareholders. The record date for the dividend is 8 December 2016 and payment will be made on 16 December 2016.

Outlook

Commenting on Arvida’s financial performance, Chairman Peter Wilson said, “we were pleased to announce a result well ahead of last year’s performance. We expect the group to continue to perform well with this momentum continuing for the full year.”

Footnotes

1 - Underlying Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and differs from NZ IFRS net profit after tax by replacing the fair value adjustment in investment property values with the Board’s estimate of realised components of movements in investment property value and to eliminate deferred tax and one-off costs.

2 - Calculated with reference to the weighted average number of shares on issue for the period.

    AWF Madison announces retirement of Associate Director
    12:03pm, 14 Dec 2016 | DIRECTOR
  

  NZX RELEASE

14 December 2016

Rachel Hopkins, who joined the Board of the AWF Madison Group as an Associate Director, in May 2015, under the Institute of Directors’ Future Directors program (the “Program”), has retired from the Board of the Company as her tenure under the Program has come to an end. 
Run by the Institute of Directors, the Program provides a basis where the next generation of directors receive mentoring, advice, and practical insight into the boardroom, while host boards get a new perspective and expertise on emerging issues like sustainability and social media. 
AWF Madison Group chair Ross Keenan said: “In my view Rachel certainly contributed to the Board in a manner that we had hoped for, in a style that was well respected by my colleagues and me”. 
As a result of Rachel’s positive contribution, AWF Madison Group proposes continuing to participate in the Program, and will work with executive search firm Hobson Leavy, who undertook the search previously, to find the right person for the role. 
“Future Directors is a fantastic opportunity to bridge the generation gap in governance,” says AWF Madison Group’s Simon Hull. “We’re very proud to be involved and can’t speak highly enough of the whole process.”

    Bethunes Investments Limited - Half Year Result
    9:24am, 29 Nov 2016 | HALFYR
  

  29 November 2016 

Interim Result Announcement

Bethunes Investments Limited (BIL) reported a loss for the six months ended 30 September 2016 of $111,962. The financial statements are attached with this announcement.

The Net Tangible Assets of BIL as at 30 September 2016 amounted to $598,967, or $0.005 per share.

Whilst required to present financial results from the prior comparable period, the only true comparative to the Company as at 30 September is the balance sheet as at 31 March 2016 as BIL disposed of all operating businesses in the year ended 31 March 2016.

The BIL Directors continued the process of winding up past operations and the previous trading subsidiary (BIL 2016 Limited) has all but settled one matter. We expect to conclude this favourably for the Company in the next few weeks.

Mossgreen continued to make instalments as part of the sales agreement with regard to Webb’s. The undiscounted receivable totals $360,000 as at 29 November 2016 – it should be noted that the receivable is discounted in the Company’s accounts in line with financial reporting standard requirements.

Over the past six months the Directors have studied a number of value creating opportunities and potential new investment opportunities and are pleased to report they have identified two potential investments, which the Company would like to undertake or increase exposure to. While we cannot provide specifics at this point in time due to confidentiality obligations and the fact that the investments remain incomplete proposals – a general outline is provided below: 

Investment A – is a consumer products company with iconic brands and no net debt, which BIL already holds an investment in. Should BIL increase its stake in this company it is the Director’s intention to pass through this company’s net dividend/s to BIL shareholders and thus make BIL a dividend-paying share as a result.

Investment B (at a less advanced stage) – is an agricultural based company, which BIL does not hold an investment in, where it is proposed BIL would be acquiring an equity interest at the Net Tangible Asset value based on market valuations. The assets include commercial real estate, a dairy farm, stock and associated equipment and dairy company shares. Based on information received to date this investment should be cash generative based on current forecasts and payout ratios, but more importantly will facilitate further investments into a part of the value chain that most investors cannot access at this point in time.

With these two investment options in front of BIL the Directors would like to signal it is BIL’s intention to raise up to NZ$ 12.5mln from shareholders before the end of Q2 2017. At this stage it is intended that this capital raise would be by way of a renounceable rights issue to give our existing shareholders the first opportunity to participate. However, we are aware that this capital raise will clearly require new shareholders to be found as well as the support of existing shareholders, and accordingly the Directors welcome preliminary expressions of interest.

We expect to be in a position to provide more details on these proposed investments in the capital raising documents to be prepared in connection with the intended capital raising.

    Study Results - BLIS K12 Probiotic- Strep Throat
    2:26pm, 13 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  MEDIA RELEASE

February 13, 2017.

Study results show K12 probiotic helps prevent rheumatic fever

As the Government launches a new rheumatic fever awareness campaign this week, results from a recent European clinical trial show that the daily use of a Kiwi-developed oral probiotic, BLIS K12 TM, is associated with a significant and ongoing reduction in throat infections and other streptococcal diseases among children.1

Rheumatic fever is a complication of a throat infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Left untreated, the bacteria can cause serious health problems, including heart failure or heart valve damage. Children and young people from Pacific and Māori communities are the most vulnerable. 

The Government’s $65 million programme to reduce the number of new rheumatic fever cases by two-thirds by June 2017 is falling behind its target and the goal might not be reached till 2019 or later. 

BLIS K12 or Streptococcus salivarius K12 is the world’s first probiotic for the mouth and throat and is hostile to the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of throat infections in humans. 

“BLIS K12 populates the mouth and throat with a beneficial strain of Streptococcus salivarius which not only crowds out the bad bacteria, but produces antimicrobial peptides that add a level of protection against them coming back.  As this latest study shows, it is effective in preventing streptococcal throat infections.  

We believe this probiotic should be considered, alongside other strategies, as one way of reducing streptococcal sore throats and the possible complications such as rheumatic fever in our communities,” explains BLIS Technologies chief technology officer, Dr John Hale. 

The study, published in the Drug Healthcare and Patient Safety Journal by a team from Velleja Research led by Dr Francesco Di Pierro in Italy, ran an observational study of 124 schoolchildren in 2014.  The treated group of 48 children with a recent history of recurrent pharyngeal streptococcal disease (sore throats) received a daily oral dose of BLIS K12 for 90 days.  A control group of 76 children with no recent history of sore throats who were not given BLIS K12 was also monitored. 

During the trial the incidence of throat infections (streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis) was reduced by 90 percent in the treated group compared to the previous (pre-treatment) year and was lower than the untreated low risk control group. 
The authors reported that the results agree with previous findings that BLIS K12 offers benefits to children in reducing streptococcal disease along with some other throat and ear infections.2

BLIS K12 is present in ThroatGuard Lozenges and ToddlerProtect powder, both of which are available over-the-counter from pharmacies and online at www.blis.co.nz

    Blis Technologies Limited- NZX Release
    9:18am, 20 Feb 2017 | FORECAST
  

  Updated guidance

Blis Technologies reports that it now does not expect to meet its previous guidance of net profit before tax in excess of $700,000. However, the company does expect to record a maiden profit for the year to 31 March 2017.

Forecast total trading revenue has reduced significantly in the months of February and March.  The reduction is due to changes in buying patterns by three major customers to reduce their product inventory compared with what had been forecast. For two cases, this is a result of change of ownership. It is important to note that the changes do not reflect any change in underlying customer demand but instead reflect changes in timing of purchases by these customers.

The company now expects trading revenue to be around $6.5m for the year to 31 March 2017.

Recognition of tax asset based on the move to profitability

To date the company has not recognised deferred income tax assets.  A decision has been taken to recognise a portion of these tax assets in the current financial year reflecting the company’s transition to profitable operations.  The tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised and that shareholder continuity requirements are met.  Accordingly, a tax asset of approximately $1.3m is expected to be recognised.

Brian Watson 
Chief Executive

    Reverse Listing Transaction with NZ Retail Property Group
    8:30am,  9 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  9 March 2017

NZX Announcement 

Reverse Listing Transaction with NZ Retail Property Group Limited 

BIL is pleased to announce that it has signed a non-binding conditional term sheet (Term Sheet) with Westgate Power Centre Limited (Westgate) and NZ Retail Property Group Limited (NZRPG). 

NZRPG, a privately owned property development, investment and management company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westgate.  Further information regarding NZRPG follows.

Based on the current asset values involved in the reverse listing, BIL believes this transaction, if approved, is likely to be the largest reverse listing to occur on the New Zealand capital markets.

Transaction Summary

The transaction will involve all of BIL’s assets (except the NZX Bond of NZ$ 75,000 and $25,000 in cash) being transferred into BIL’s wholly owned subsidiary, BIL 2016 Limited (New BIL). The shares of New BIL will then be distributed pro rata to all of BIL’s existing shareholders. New BIL will assume the name Bethunes Investments Limited.

The business of NZRPG will then be reverse listed into the resulting shell of BIL through BIL issuing shares to Westgate in exchange for all of the shares in NZRPG. BIL will then assume the name NZ Retail Property Group Limited.

Accordingly, the effect for BIL shareholders if the transaction is completed is that they will retain their current BIL shares which become an interest in NZRPG but will also, for no consideration, receive shares in New BIL which will be an interest in the same assets and business plan that BIL presently has.

Valuation

The initial indicative and non-binding estimates for the transaction are:

• The shares in NZRPG are estimated at approximately $400 million.

• The shares in Bethunes (less the assets and receivable held in BIL 2016 Limited) on a debt free basis valued at $1.0 million plus the NZX Bond of $75,000 and $25,000 cash.

Based on these valuations Westgate will hold approximately 99% of the share capital in BIL.  These values are however subject to final determination and agreement and may vary.

Conditions 

The transactions contemplated by the Term Sheet are conditional on:

• BIL conducting a due diligence investigation of NZRPG.
• Westgate conducting a due diligence investigation of BIL.  
• Entry into legally binding transaction documents between BIL and Westgate.
• Obtaining any necessary waivers from NZX that are required in order to proceed with the transaction.
• BIL obtaining all shareholder approvals that may be required to undertake the transactions, including under the Companies Act 1993, the Takeovers Code and the NZX Listing Rules.  

A notice of special meeting to approve the transactions, and all other required documentation, will be circulated to BIL shareholders in due course. Such documentation will include an independent report and appraisal report on the merits of the transaction as required under the Takeovers Code and the NZX Listing Rules. A profile document on the business of NZRPG will also circulated as required under the Listing Rules.

Timetable

Under the Term Sheet, BIL will seek to hold the required shareholders’ meeting by 30 June 2017 with the intention of completing the transactions shortly after such approvals are obtained.  

Reasons for the Transaction

As noted above the current business plan and assets of BIL will continue in New BIL which BIL shareholders will directly own. Accordingly completing the transactions can only add value for BIL shareholders as they will also own an interest in NZRPG. 

In addition, NZRPG is meeting the costs of the transactions and BIL is only liable to pay its share of the costs if shareholders vote against the transaction, BIL terminates the transaction without cause or BIL materially breaches the transaction documents. Accordingly the Board can only see upside for shareholders in undertaking the transaction and believes it is in their best interests.

The BIL Board is investigating either re-listing New BIL following the transactions or placing New BIL on an alternative share trading platform to retain some liquidity in New BIL. A decision on this will be made at a later time but prior to shareholders being asked to vote on the transaction.

For and on behalf of the Board,

Christopher Swasbrook
Chairman

About New Zealand Retail Property Group (NZRPG)

NZRPG is one of New Zealand’s largest privately held retail ownership, management and development companies with over 100,000 square meters of leasable space in the portfolio. The total portfolio of mixed-use assets is valued at significantly higher than the transaction value of $400 million. For over 30 years, NZRPG has been completing development and construction projects across New Zealand, solidifying their position as a long-standing player in the New Zealand property development market. 

With a core specialisation in retail, NZRPG actively invests in the development of the long term property assets that are owned in the portfolio and that offer the opportunity to add value through mixed use expansion, development and redevelopment. The property portfolio includes three strategic Town Centres located in Auckland and a Shopping Centre in Tauranga. 

The intention of NZ Retail Property Group is to grow the company’s investment portfolio through the strategic development of existing retail centres into planned town environments and the development of mixed use assets that derive the highest value per square meter. 

Historically income generated from property assets has, to a large part, been utilised to fund the ongoing development, planning and design processes necessary to ensure the long term opportunity for these town centres. As a result, NZRPG is now uniquely positioned with a significant and long term development pipeline, which will provide long term income and value growth.  NZRPG is seeking capital to realize these plans and a reverse listing is intended to support securing new capital.

NZRPG is presenting to investors the opportunity to take part in one of the most significant retail property development pipelines in New Zealand. The company is seeking capital to embark on the next phase of its pipeline, which includes one of New Zealand’s biggest mixed use property development opportunities – Westgate town centre. 

In addition to the ongoing completion of the 48.5 hectare Westgate Town Centre, both the Milford Centre and Highbury centre on Auckland’s North Shore are undergoing retail development with a residential overlay. The success of these developments is underpinned by the expansive urban town planning that is reshaping Auckland. 

These growth opportunities include the provision of residential overlays to all the town centre properties (Milford, Highbury and Westgate) which will both enhance the retail performance of the centres and allow for significant tranches of capital to be recycled into the core business. The Milford development plan is underway with completion due in Mid-2019.

    Market Update
    1:10pm,  7 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Announcement - 7 April 2017
 
The Board of Bethunes Investments Limited (BIL) met today to review the past year. KPMG our auditors have started work on the annual audit and the Directors expect to issue BIL's audited results to shareholders before the end of May 2017.
 
In an effort to lower costs for the year ahead, the Board has today appointed Christopher Swasbrook - Chairman of BIL with additional executive responsibilities. This arrangement ceases: (i) a director’s fee paid to Mr. Swasbrook last year; and (ii) the contract with Elevation Capital Management Limited for analytical services. The company has two investment ideas developed by Elevation Capital and Mr. Swasbrook that it is currently exploring outside of the announced reverse listing of New Zealand Retail Property Group (NZRPG).
 
As indicated previously, the company will require additional capital to execute on any future investments and shareholders can expect to receive an update at the Annual Shareholder Meeting (ASM), which is expected to coincide with a Special Meeting for the NZRPG transaction.

Ends.

Independent Director

    Changes to Board of Directors
    12:45pm,  5 Apr 2017 | DIRECTOR
  

  Airwork announces a number of changes to its Board of Directors.

Mike Daniel has stood down as Chairman of the Board but remains an independent director of the Company.  Mr Jie Wu has been appointed as Chairman.  Mr Wu is Chairman of Airwork’s majority shareholder, Zhejiang Rifa Holding Group Co. Ltd and was appointed to the Board upon completion of the recent partial takeover.  In addition, Simon Craddock, Martin Gray and Mark Pitt have been appointed as directors and Rob Flannagan has resigned.

Simon Craddock is an experienced executive with a background in corporate strategy, operations and performance improvement with Air New Zealand, Deloitte, and Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare.  He specialises in strategic planning and transformational change initiatives and has worked across the aviation, healthcare, tourism, defence, manufacturing, and financial services sectors.  Simon sits on the board of the Public Trust and the Harvard Business School Association of NZ, and is a member of the Institute of Directors. 

Martin Gray has over 20 years of corporate finance experience in Asia, New Zealand and Europe and headed M&amp;A services for EY in New Zealand.  His key areas of expertise include mergers and acquisitions, business disposals, finance raisings, project finance, independent expert reports, valuations, and due diligence, with substantial listed and private company lead advisory experience. Martin holds a Bachelor of Commerce and a Diploma in Business (Finance) from the University of Auckland, and the CA qualification through Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. 

Mark Pitt has 25 years’ experience as a pilot, initially as an international military pilot and later as a domestic airline pilot instructor.  He was the Chief Executive of Air New Zealand subsidiary Mount Cook Airline, Managing Director and Chair of Virgin Samoa and, most recently, Managing Director and Chief Executive of Virgin Australia New Zealand.  Mark is currently a director of Airways, New Zealand’s air navigation service provider, and has also served as a director of a number of Boards including Virgin Australia New Zealand and the Board of Airline Representatives New Zealand Incorporated (BARNZ).  He is owner and director of distribution company Quinn International Ltd and manufacturing and distribution company G&amp;M Pty Ltd in Australia, and runs a consultancy called Frontseat which specialises in leadership and marketing.

As required by NZX Main Board Listing Rule 3.3.3(b), the Board has determined that Mr Craddock and Mr Pitt are not independent directors, and that Mr Gray is an independent director.  In accordance with the NZX Main Board Listing Rule 3.3.6, the new directors will retire and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the 2017 annual meeting.

As advised on 20 March, Rob Flannagan had notified Airwork of his intention to resign.  He has now formally tendered his resignation, effective from today.   Rob joined the Board in 2013, immediately prior to the listing of the Companies shares on NZX, and he has served as Chairman of the Audit Committee over that period.  The Board acknowledges Rob’s contribution to Airwork through its foundation years as a listed company and wishes him well for the future.

Yours faithfully

Chris Hart
Chief Executive

25 January 2017
AWF MADISON GROUP LIMITED (NZX: AWF) – 
The Board of AWF was informed at its meeting today, that Alex Park, the COO of subsidiary AWF Limited (the “Company”), has indicated that he wishes to pursue other interests, and has, accordingly, resigned his position with effect from March 2017.

Simon said that with Alex’s resignation, he would be reviewing the Company’s management structure and would be considering the most appropriate one for that business going forward, which may, initially, include a greater personal involvement, until that structure is finalised.

    APPOINTMENT OF SUBSIDIARY (AWF LIMITED) GENERAL MANAGERS
    2:58pm,  3 Feb 2017 | OFFICE
  

  NZX Release

3 February 2017

AWF MADISON GROUP LIMITED (NZX: AWF) – APPOINTMENT OF SUBSIDIARY (AWF LIMITED) GENERAL MANAGERS.

On 25 January 2017, AWF announced the resignation of AWF Limited’s COO, with effect from March 2017; and CEO, Simon Bennett, would be reviewing the Company’s management structure, in light of this. 

There is ongoing review and structural adaptations to the operational structure of the business, in order to take advantage of the Company’s growth nationally and the ever-changing landscape of the labour market.  The Board of AWF, on the CEO’s advice, considers it appropriate, at this time, to divide operations geographically – into a Northern region and a Southern region. Each region will report to a General Manager, who will report to the CEO. “This will allow for a greater strategic business focus and flexibility, drive operational and systems improvement to support the business as it grows”; said Simon.

With effect from March 2017, the Northern region will be managed by Fleur Board, who is a 30 year veteran of the recruitment services industry, the past 8 of which have been with AWF.  During her career spanning both Australia and New Zealand with global and national providers, Fleur has held senior operational and sales management roles with a primary focus on market share growth and development of greenfield opportunities. Fleur will be based in Auckland. The Southern Region will be managed by Donna Lynch, based in Palmerston North. Donna has a wealth of operational experience gained over 20 years in senior management roles in sales and marketing in fields of human capital, culminating in a national leadership role for a global recruitment company.

Simon said “I am very excited to announce the appointment of Donna and particularly pleased to be able to promote Fleur from within the organisation. “

    Augusta Capital Increases NPT Stake to 18.85% 
    9:37am,  7 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE
7 April 2017

Augusta Capital Increases Stake to 18.85% Ahead of NPT Special Meeting 

Augusta Capital today announces it has increased its shareholding in NPT Limited (NPT) to 18.85% following the acquisition of a further 9.59% stake in NPT from other shareholders.  The total amount to be paid was $10,559,674, with settlement to occur on Tuesday, 11 April 2017.  Following that, Augusta Capital will be the largest shareholder in NPT.  

Augusta Capital Managing Director Mark Francis says: “This week’s acquisition of shares in NPT is consistent with our long-standing plan to grow our funds management business and significantly, it strengthens our position ahead of the NPT Special Meeting on 21 April 2017.”

“Having now carefully assessed the Kiwi Property proposal being recommended by the NPT Board – we remain firmly of a view that it is not in the interest of NPT shareholders.”

“While we respect Kiwi Property the current proposal is heavily skewed in their favour – falling well short of what we consider to be fair and reasonable for NPT shareholders.

“Augusta intends to vote against the Kiwi Property proposal and is aware of a number of other shareholders who have indicated their intention to vote against the Kiwi Property Proposal.  We would encourage all NPT shareholders to seek independent specialist advice concerning its merits before casting their vote,” Mr Francis adds.

“We believe the current Board is completely out of touch with its shareholders in recommending this deal, and Augusta Capital will also be voting for change through resolutions two to six, to remove two of the current board members, noting that the previous Chairman has already stepped down,” Mr Francis concludes.

Augusta Capital wishes to remind fellow NPT shareholders that the deadline for voting papers reaching Link Market Services is 11.00am on Wednesday 19th April 2017.

  NZX Release
21 April 2017

Augusta Capital notes the outcome of today’s NPT Special Meeting

Augusta Capital today wishes to acknowledge the outcome of today’s NPT Special Meeting where a majority of voting shareholders rejected the Kiwi proposal and voted for the introduction of a substantially new Board.

Augusta Capital’s Managing Director, Mark Francis, says “The will of NPT’s shareholders has seen a poor proposal rejected and the governance changed; we are grateful for the support afforded to us by those shareholders.

“As outlined to NPT shareholders today our proposed next step will be to present a proposal to externalise the management to Augusta. We can run this company for a lot less, which will realise an uplift in earnings and the current net tangible asset backing per share.

“This will also introduce a much needed alignment of interests under a proven manager motivated to deliver greater returns for all NPT shareholders.

Augusta manages over $1.7 billion in property assets and has consistently been one of the best performing NZX listed property stock over the last five years.

Mr Francis adds “We have a track-record of successfully extracting value from non-performing assets and we are backing ourselves to unlock value from NPT’s existing assets, and then look to deliver much needed scale to the business based on owning quality assets in the right markets. 

“It is now incumbent on Augusta to put forward a superior proposal to the Kiwi deal for consideration by the new Board on behalf of all other NPT shareholders,” Mr Francis says.

    Aorere exclusive option expires
    3:32pm,  3 Mar 2017 | MINE
  

  3 March 2017
NZX Market Announcement
AORERE EXCLUSIVE OPTION EXPIRES ON NEVADA PROJECT 
 Aorere advises its exclusive option to acquire American Innovative Minerals (“AIM”) in Nevada has expired.
 AIM, which holds the rights to the Fondaway Canyon gold project as well as a number of other exploration prospects, has advised it has entered into an alternative proposal, which it expects to settle in March.
 Managing director Chris Castle said Aorere remained interested in the Nevada assets, and will keep a watching brief on this transaction given it has yet to be finalised.
Aorere has worked over the past 10 months to assess the potential of the Nevada resources and sought to find partners with capital to invest, achieving three extensions of an exclusivity arrangement.  Over the past couple of months Aorere sought additional capital from shareholders to finance the ongoing costs of securing the AIM assets.
During the extension periods Aorere carried out due diligence, completed metallurgy studies, updated the independent resource report and identified a third party to fund the acquisition.  That party ultimately did not conclude its arrangements.
While there is still a possibility the current sale of AIM to a third party will not be concluded, Aorere is disappointed the significant efforts made so far have not resulted in a deal.
Aorere’s research identified a significant increase in the mineral resource estimate to 1,069,000 ounces at a gold grade of 6.3 grams per tonne on a combined indicated and inferred basis.  Detailed technical assessment and new resource modelling demonstrated this project has the potential to become a significant mine in resource-rich, mine-friendly Nevada, USA.
Mr Castle said Aorere would inform the market once AIM advises the result of its current proposal.
Regards,
Chris Castle

    Aorere provides update on Nevada gold project 
    8:30am,  7 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  7 March 2017

NZX Market Announcement

AORERE CONFIRMS NEVADA PROJECT EXPECTED TO GO TO ANOTHER PARTY

The Nevada gold prospects Aorere Resources has investigated over the past year have conditionally been sold to another party.

Vancouver based Canarc Resource Corp has announced it has executed a binding letter of agreement with American Innovative Minerals (“AIM”), owner of 10 gold properties in Nevada, plus other interests.

Under the terms of the agreement, Canarc will pay US$2 million cash for 100 per cent of AIM’s outstanding securities or a 100 per cent interest in AIM’s assets. Canarc paid a deposit of US$200,000 on signing the agreement, to be credited against the purchase price on completing the acquisition, which Canarc expects to achieve by March 31.

Canarc described the acquisition as an attractive portfolio of gold exploration properties in Nevada with historic gold resources and significant exploration potential at a low acquisition cost in the prolific and mining friendly jurisdiction of Nevada.  Canarc’s announcement regarding the purchase refers to the work undertaken by Aorere.  

The purchase includes what Aorere believes is the key asset of Fondaway Canyon, an advanced stage gold property previously explored and mined in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, with indicated resources of 409,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 6.18 g/t gold and inferred resources of 660,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 6.4 g/t gold, using a cut-off grade of 3.43 g/t gold. 

Managing director Chris Castle said Aorere would continue to watch the transaction given it has yet to be finalised.  Over the past year Aorere assessed the potential of the Nevada resources and sought to find partners with capital to invest, achieving two extensions of an exclusivity arrangement to carry out due diligence, complete metallurgy studies, update the independent resource report and identify a third party to fund the acquisition.  That party ultimately did not conclude its arrangements.

    4:28pm, 23 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  New Zealand Exchange Limited 
P.O. Box 2959 
Wellington

23 March 2017 

Dear Sir, 

Aorere’s Asian Minerals announces management and board changes         

Asian Mineral Resources (“ASN”) is Aorere’s second largest investment. This shareholding represents 24% of Widespread’s total assets at ASN’s current market value of 2.5 cents in Canada.     

ASN made the following announcement in Canada overnight which signals a period of likely change for the company. The good news is that we are still represented on the board continuing a 17 year involvement by Aorere with this company.  
 
For and on behalf of the Board,

Chris D Castle
Managing Director 
Aorere Resources Limited 

Asian Mineral Resources Limited: Management and Board Changes
TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - March 22, 2017) - Asian Mineral Resources Limited (""AMR"" or the ""Company"") (TSX VENTURE:ASN) is pleased to announce changes to the management and Board of the company. The changes to the management and Board are designed to reposition the company to more effectively and efficiently advance the follow-up on the advanced-stage nickel exploration prospects on AMR's tenements in the prolific Son Da rift zone in Vietnam. 
Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Duncan Blount has today been appointed Chief Executive Officer of AMR. Mr Blount is a highly experienced executive with over 10 years of investment experience focused on the natural resources sector. Most recently, Mr. Blount was Head of Emerging and Frontier Market Commodities for RWC Partners, responsible for developing their commodity and natural resources portfolio strategy. Mr Blount holds a BA in Language and World Trade from Samford University and an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global Management.
Mr. Blount takes over the CEO role from Mr. Evan Spencer with immediate effect, though Mr. Spencer will remain with the Company during a transition period.
Mr Robin Widdup, Non-Executive Chairman of AMR stated, ""On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Evan for his tireless efforts in successfully steering the company through the completion of construction and operational ramp up of AMR's Ban Phuc Nickel Mine in Northern Vietnam through a very tough economic environment. Under Evan's leadership the Ban Phuc mine and processing facility transformed into a modern world class mining operation and an industry leader in Vietnam. We wish him well for the future. We welcome Mr Blount to the company and look forward to his leadership in realizing the full potential of the Ban Phuc project.""

Chief Financial Officer
In keeping with the transition of the company to an exploration focused company, Mr. Sean Duffy will be leaving AMR at the end of March 2017 and Ms. Paula Kember, currently Corporate Secretary, will take on the role of CFO and Corporate Secretary.
Mr. Evan Spencer, outgoing CEO of AMR stated ""Sean's financial leadership and guidance of the company through historically low nickel prices was a key contributing factor to AMR's reputation as a pioneer and a key industry leader in Vietnam. The management and board of AMR wish Sean well for his future.""
Board of Directors
In accordance with the intent to transition AMR into an exploration company the AMR Board has also been streamlined to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and suitability for delivering on the exploration and development potential of AMR's exploration portfolio. In line with this restructuring Mr. Jim Askew (Non-Executive Chairman), Mr. Mike Brown and Mr. Evgenij Iorich did not seek re-election to the board of AMR at the annual AGM held on the 6th March 2017. 
The Board currently consists of Mr. Robin Widdup (Chairman), Mr. Chris Castle and Mr. Martyn Buttenshaw.
Mr. Evan Spencer, outgoing CEO of AMR stated ""We thank Jim, Mike and Evgenij for the significant contributions that they have made to the company during their tenure, successfully guiding the company from early stage exploration project to a modern world-class mining operation."" 
ABOUT AMR
AMR owns and operates one of the world's few sources of nickel sulphide ore, and is exploring for additional high-grade nickel assets in Vietnam. AMR commenced commercial production from its 90%- owned Ban Phuc Nickel Mine in Vietnam in mid-2013. As of 30 June 2016, the Ban Phuc Nickel Mine has produced a total of c. 20,000 tonnes of nickel and c. 10,000 tonnes of copper contained in concentrate, plus a cobalt by-product since the beginning of its mine life. Mining and processing operations at Ban Phuc were suspended in September 2016 and operations were transitioned to a care and maintenance scenario. In addition to in and near-mine expansion projects, Ban Phuc provides a platform from which AMR can continue to focus on developing a new nickel camp within its 150km2 of concessions located throughout the highly-prolific Song Da rift zone, where AMR has a number of advanced-stage nickel exploration targets. 
For further details on AMR, please refer to the technical report entitled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report - Ban Phuc Nickel Project"" dated February 15, 2013 available on SEDAR or the AMR website www.asianmineralres.com.

    Argosy Agrees 9-Year Lease at 82 Wyndham Street
    11:20am,  4 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Argosy has today announced that it has successfully reached an agreement to lease approximately 2,657 square metres of space across two floors at 82 Wyndham Street in central Auckland to Panuku Development Auckland, an Auckland Council organisation.

The lease is for a term of 9 years, with a break clause (with penalty) at 6 years, and will commence in August 2017.

The top floor of the building is leased to long term tenant Boffa Miskell on a recently renewed lease leaving one 1,575 square metre floor available.  The remaining floor is being marketed for lease, with good enquiry, and will be available for occupation in the second half of FY18.

Argosy is completing an extensive $9 million refurbishment of the entire building. The upgrade is being completed to a high standard including a minimum 4 Green Star¹ built rating and is targeting a 4 Star NABERSNZ² energy efficiency rating.  

Following the upgrade, the building will provide very efficient, cost effective space and an attractive working environment for tenants.  New services will include facilities to encourage cycling to work, an increase in the building’s fresh air supply, a smart lighting system linked to automatic blinds, a window film that improves solar conversion, a variable refrigerant flow air conditioning system and the latest water saving and metering systems to enable usage to be measured for NABERSNZ. 

¹Green Star rating tools have been developed by the NZGBC (New Zealand Green Building Council) as a way of predicting the energy use and environmental impact of a building from the design phase to completion. 
²The NABERSNZ rating system is based solely on the actual energy use of existing buildings.

    Comvita Announces Half Year Results
    9:54am, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  For the six month period ending 31 December 2016, Comvita (NZX:CVT) today announced a net loss after tax of $7.1m on sales of $57.7m.  This result is in line with earlier guidance, and compares with a reported net profit after tax (NPAT) of $3.0m on sales of $91.1m for the six month period to 30 September 2015. The interim results for both periods are unaudited. 

At an operating level, adjusting for changes in fair value of derivatives, the net loss after tax was $4.4m.  The difference between the reported NPAT and the operating NPAT is the revaluation of Comvita’s options in SeaDragon (NZX:SEA) down by $2.8m.

Financial results for the period six months to 31 December 2016 (six months to 30 September 2015)

Sales 2016 $57.7m, 2015 $91.1m
EBITDA* 2016 ($2.8m), 2015 $10.2m
EBITDA% 2016 (5.0%), 2015 11.0%
NPAT 2016 ($7.1m), 2015 $3.0m
Earnings per share (cents) 2016 (17.18), 2015 7.69
Dividends per share (cents) 2016 2.0, 2015 6.0
ROCE 2016 ( 3.0%), 2015 4.0%

* EBITDA: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
** ROCE: return on capital employed.

Comvita Chairman Neil Craig says, “As we signalled in our market update of 23 January, informal channel sales to China through Asian resellers in Australia and New Zealand are down on expectations and the 2016 comparative period.  The poor interim result is almost entirely a result of the drop in sales in these two markets.  While this result is very disappointing, we are very pleased with the mitigating actions taken by the management team, including cost reduction initiatives, with a focus on productivity and ongoing innovation and product development.  The changes made to the business this year will set us up well for further growth in earnings beyond the excellent 2016 result when the sales environment improves.  The board believes the company is still well placed to meet its long term strategic objectives.” 

Dividend 
“On 23 January 2017, we advised that we anticipated our 2017 after tax operating earnings would be in the range of $5-7m.  In keeping with our current dividend payment policy of 40-45% of annual after tax operating profits, we will pay a fully imputed interim dividend of two cents per share on 21 March 2017 for those shares registered 14 March 2017.” 

Derma Sciences, Inc. Post Half Year Event
Mr. Craig said, “We believe the Derma Science (Nasdaq:DSCI) transaction is an exceptional one for our shareholders.  We sold the Medihoney brand for NZ $19m, however we have retained the worldwide rights to use the brand in over the counter (OTC) channels.  We have also entered into a new manufacturing agreement that enables us to lower our costs for products in our range that require Medical Device certifications, and develop a Medihoney branded Manuka honey band-aid.  The agreement also provides for Comvita to supply bulk, medical grade Manuka honey on a commercial basis over the long term.  

US company Integra Life Sciences (Nasdaq:IART) has made an offer to buy Derma Sciences at US$7 per share which values our stake at approximately NZ$11m.  The total value of the Medihoney sale and the share sale is approximately NZ$30m immediately, with the prospect of a further US$5m over several years, provided certain Medihoney sales targets are met by Integra.” 

“With the share placement made to China Resources on 26 October 2016 of $21m and the recent Derma Sciences transaction, Comvita has a strong balance sheet.  As communicated already, these funds will be applied to debt reduction and then for funding strategic initiatives and potential acquisitions currently under consideration.”

CEO Commentary
Comvita CEO Scott Coulter said, “The business operating conditions in our two biggest markets (Australia and New Zealand) have been extremely tough over the first six months and account for most of the shortfall in revenue for the period.  We are working through a painful period of channel rebalancing from informal to more formal paths to China. This adjustment period may continue for a few more months and the informal channel business in Australasia remains the largest risk to our short term projections.  Longer term Comvita is well positioned to cement our competitive advantage through the strategic partnerships we have set up at both the supply end of its business and inside China itself.”

Our China Joint Venture is on track and expected to start from 1 July 2017.  This will improve both our profitability from China based sales and our visibility into this market. Our strategic partnership with China Resources is progressing well and we believe this relationship will enable our brand to expand more broadly into Chinese based distribution of high quality, premium, healthy food products outside our traditional bee-products base.

As we informed the market on 23 January 2017, the honey season is likely to be significantly impacted by prolonged and unfavourable weather conditions.  This was an exceptionally poor honey harvest across the country. Harvest risk is recognised as a characteristic of beekeeping and this is going to happen from time to time, although the extent this event impacted most of our Apiaries and subsequently our profitability in the second half ending 30 June, was highly unusual.

We will not have full visibility on our 2017 honey harvest until April/May 2017.  As the honey season progresses down the country from North to South, some hives are still in the field collecting honey, which means estimating the harvest is extremely difficult.  Since our last announcement, the honey season has progressed another month with little improvement in the weather conditions.  As we have mentioned previously, assuming a return to normal weather patterns next year, the operating profit impact of this poor honey harvest will be isolated to this current financial year.

Management have used the opportunity over the past six months to significantly improve our underlying operating business.  The company has reduced its operating cost base by $6.5m in the first half, and we expect full year savings of $10m compared to the prior year.  At the same time we have developed new capability in innovation, as we build towards achieving our strategic goals of value additions to our existing honey business and diversification of the product range.  We now have a dedicated innovation team within the business with a cross functional skill base including food formulating, topical products formulation, regulatory affairs, patent management, marketing and project management expertise. 

The Derma Sciences transaction enabled us to reduce debt substantially, from $82m at 31 December 2016 to $53m by 31 March 2017, an amount significantly lower than our total inventory position at $97m.

Innovation
It is important to note while we are vigorously pursuing a diversification strategy, we are not placing any less emphasis on our core bee products business, and in particular Manuka honey.  Our inventory is in a very strong position and we are opening new channels and markets for Manuka honey, as well as launching a number of new, value-added initiatives with products containing Manuka Honey.  We have launched a Manuka honey beverage range, a range of sugar free lozenges containing Manuka honey and will shortly launch therapeutic versions of pure Manuka honey lozenges. 

From Derma Sciences we expect to launch a range of Manuka honey wound dressing products by mid-2017.  The sale of the Medihoney brand to Derma Sciences still allows Comvita to have exclusive world-wide use of the Medihoney brand in the OTC market.  The Medihoney therapeutic skincare range, targeted at customers who have skin prone to Eczema, is growing strongly in Australian pharmacy channels, our largest Medihoney market at 37% on a moving annual total (MAT) basis.

Fresh Olive Leaf Extract (OLE) continues to go from strength to strength in Australia, our largest OLE market, and we have grown OLE sales in this market by 24% on an MAT basis, driven by new innovation in high strength capsules. Our focus over the next few months will be driving OLE sales and innovation in markets outside Australia. 

Markets
Japan is now one of our faster growing markets with sales increasing by 20% for the six months ended 31 December 2016. Sales to our distributor in China have impacted our Asian sales, hence the reported drop in sales over this period from $30m to $20m.  This change in sales is due to timing of shipments and seasonal differences in the reporting periods.  While sales have decreased over this period to Asia, the profit contribution made on these sales is virtually the same. This indicates a lift in profitability in our Asian business. 

Our sales data demonstrates Comvita’s underlying growth in China continues.  Over the last quarter of 2016, an important period for seasonal reasons, as this period includes the onset of winter as well as covering a number of important sales events like singles day, our China distributor sales grew at 15% compared with the same quarter in 2015.  There have been a number of marketing initiatives, including live steaming from our Paengaroa Head Office to 300,000 consumers on T-Mall, which will position our brand well for future growth.  It is also important to note that while our online business inside China continues to grow, we have a good base of offline retail locations to provide consumers with the ability to connect and engage directly with our brand.

Sales in the UK are up by 10.5% on a similar currency basis over the prior six month period.  We have several new listings in pharmacy with Boots and with Holland &amp; Barrett, the UK’s largest health food chain, which will help us drive second half growth.  The USA is growing strongly, particularly with e-commerce sales, and we expect to move into a profitable position in this market within the next 12 months.  We expect the UK, Korea and Japan to all grow this year on a same currency basis, although the Brexit impact on the UK currency will have a dampening effect in NZ dollar terms.

Overall, we expect our second half year sales to be up significantly on our first half year due to continued growth in the non-Chinese markets, improvement in Australasian sales, the effect of new sales initiatives in new and existing markets and an increasing contribution to sales from our innovation pipeline.

    EROAD launches Electronic Logging Device in US

  EROAD launches Electronic Logging Device in US

27 February 2017 Auckland Transport technology service provider EROAD (NZX:ERD) has launched its in-cab, hardware-based Electronic Logging Device (ELD) to the US market.

EROAD’s ELD was announced today at US conference ATA TMC, the American Trucking Associations’ Annual Meeting &amp; Transport Technology Exhibition in Nashville, TN. The EROAD ELD has also been submitted to the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) for inclusion on the US government’s register of providers offering services to meet new federal rules for electronically recording drivers’ hours of service. EROAD’s ELD registration is imminent.

Once published by the FMCSA, EROAD’s ELD is expected to be the 28th device on the register, and the first to offer permanent in-cab hardware as part of a comprehensive solution. The other 27 devices on the register offer less comprehensive, app-based services using a smart phone or mobile computer case without a permanent, in-cab device. EROAD’s major competitors offering in-cab hardware are yet to have ELD devices published on the FMCSA register.

Trucking firms in the US have until December 2017 to comply with a federal regulation requiring drivers to record their record of duty status electronically in a way that is tamper-resistant and readily transferrable to enforcement officers – a measure that will improve not only compliance with hours of service requirements but also the overall health and safety of fleets. EROAD has also initiated independent, third-party verification of its ELD to provide assurance to the industry that its system is compliant, best-in-class, and operationally easy to use.

Chief Executive Steven Newman said that completing a compliant ELD for the US had been a major research and development focus for the company. He was delighted to be again leading in the global provision of technology and to have achieved a milestone that the company had set itself.

“App-based ELD solutions face a number of issues including poor Bluetooth, or loss of connectivity, battery dependence, and a lack of permanent connection to the truck. If a driver misplaces, drops, or forgets their smartphone or tablet, they won’t be able to drive. All of these issues are overcome by a fixed in-cab device,” said Mr Newman.

“With the new federal regulations, having a compliant ELD is critical for most customers looking for a fleet management or electronic tax reporting solution,” he said. “Today’s launch means we are in a position to begin selling our ELD offer in the US market as planned by March, 2017.

“In parallel with completing a compliant comprehensive ELD solution, EROAD has continued to build sales and marketing capability in the US which is now under the experienced leadership of Norm Ellis, who previously led sales and marketing for one of the US’s largest telematics companies, Omnitracs,” said Mr Newman.  

He said that a significant advantage for customers was that EROAD’s ELD service was offered from its single, integrated platform, capable of also providing electronic WMT (Weight-Mile Tax) and electronic IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement) reporting, as well as sophisticated fleet management.

“Customers can meet and manage their tax and health and safety compliance commitments all in one service, as well as improving productivity and reducing cost through our fleet management and driver behaviour services,” he said.
Launching its in-cab ELD system continues EROAD’s success at world-leading technology solutions. In 2009, EROAD introduced the world’s first nationwide electronic road user charging (RUC) system in New Zealand. It then launched in 2013 the US’s first electronic WMT service in Oregon, and has now introduced the US’s first compliant in-cab ELD. In early 2016, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) selected EROAD as its heavy vehicle technology provider for the California Road Charge Pilot, the US’s largest road charge pilot, running for nine months from July2016, to investigate new technology in road charging options for possible replacement of or in addition to California’s fuel tax. 

About EROAD
EROAD modernises road charging and compliance for road transport by replacing paper-based systems with easy-to-use electronic systems. The company is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand, and listed on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). Its US business is based in Portland, Oregon, serving customers with vehicles operating in every US mainland state, growing outward in concentration from the Northwest. In 2009 EROAD introduced the world’s first nationwide electronic road user charging (eRUC) system in New Zealand and, in 2017, more than 50% of heavy transport RUC is expected to be collected electronically, representing a rapid transition to e-commerce on a voluntary, industry-led basis, due to the cost-savings and benefits to customers. EROAD is also a leading provider of health and safety compliance services, including vehicle management and driver behaviour and performance measures.

    EROAD launches vehicle inspection mobile app in New Zealand

  EROAD launches vehicle inspection mobile app in New Zealand
 

2 March 2017 Auckland Transport technology service provider EROAD (NZX:ERD) today launched its pre- and post-trip safety inspection checks for commercial vehicles with its EROAD Inspect mobile application. 

EROAD CEO Steven Newman said the app was developed to help customers meet increasingly stringent health and safety obligations — a pressure transport operators are facing globally. 

“Keeping vehicles and assets safely maintained is a complex problem for our customers,” Mr Newman said. “We’re delighted to be helping solve that problem with a simple, elegant solution that they can customise to suit the vehicles in their fleets, to improve safety and reduce the administrative costs of manual inspections.”

EROAD Inspect eliminates paper, and a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to inspections. It enables operators to assign configurable inspection templates to a vehicle or asset. It also automatically records and saves the information input by drivers, providing an accurate record of inspections that operators can rely on for safety compliance.

EROAD Inspect guides drivers through inspections, and allows them to submit reports electronically. It interfaces with EROAD’s web application, Depot, with exception-based reporting that shows vehicle managers or maintenance staff back at the office items that have failed an inspection or require attention. 

Configurable templates mean drivers can select an inspection type – truck, tractor, vehicle or equipment – and assign it to a vehicle in Depot. 

“With web access to the information, it makes it easy for fleet managers to stay ahead of maintenance to keep vehicles in prime operating condition. Plus, clear records exist of all checks to demonstrate an operators’ care and attention in looking after their vehicles and their drivers,” Mr Newman said. 

He said the app would be useful not only for heavy vehicle operators but to anyone operating a vehicle or a fleet of vehicles in their business.

Changes in New Zealand health and safety law, which took effect a year ago this April, mean vehicles that are used for work are considered workplaces, and must offer a safe working environment for drivers, the community and other road users. 

“We see a wide scope for this product because it isn’t just the big trucks that need regular inspection checks,” he said.

Mr Newman said EROAD intended to offer EROAD Inspect in the US market also in FY2018, with the company’s R&amp;D increasingly being aimed at applications and new services that could be offered across a number of markets.

EROAD Inspect is available now for Apple and Android mobile devices.

    EROAD achieves US first with registration of ELD

  EROAD achieves US first, with registration of Electronic Logging Device

2 March 2017 Auckland Transport technology service provider EROAD (NZX:ERD) has successfully registered the first in-cab, hardware-based Electronic Logging Device (ELD)  for the US market.

EROAD’s ELD has been listed on the US government’s register of providers offering services to meet new federal rules for electronically recording drivers’ hours of service. 

EROAD’s device is the first on the register to offer permanent in-cab hardware as part of a comprehensive solution. The other 30 devices on the register offer less comprehensive app-based services using a smart phone or heavy mobile computer case without a permanent, in-cab device. EROAD’s major competitors offering in-cab hardware are yet to have ELD devices listed on the ELD register.

EROAD launched its ELD on Monday this week at ATA TMC, the American Trucking Associations’ Annual Meeting &amp; Transport Technology Exhibition in Nashville, TN. 

Trucking firms in the US have until December 2017 to comply with a federal regulation requiring drivers to record their record of duty status electronically in a way that is tamper-resistant and readily transferrable to enforcement officers. EROAD has also initiated independent, third-party verification to provide assurance to the industry that its system is compliant, best-in-class, and operationally easy to use.

“Having our ELD accepted onto the FMCSA register means we are able to offer a compliant ELD to the US market this month, as scheduled,” EROAD CEO, Steven Newman said.

EROAD’s ELD is offered on the same, integrated platform, as its electronic tax, safety and fleet management services, including electronic IFTA, Oregon Weight Mile Tax, driver and vehicle analytics, and real-time fleet tracking.

    EROAD suspends employee charged by FMA
    9:13am,  9 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Technology services provider EROAD has suspended an employee against whom the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has filed charges relating to insider trading. The employee is not a member of the senior executive team.

The FMA has filed charges alleging breaches of the insider trading prohibitions contained in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 by one current and one former EROAD employee. 
 
EROAD Chairman Mr Bushby noted that the FMA action is directed at two individuals, and that EROAD’s conduct is not the subject of investigation. EROAD supports and endorses the FMA’s commitment to the integrity of the capital markets in New Zealand, and has fully co-operated with and assisted the FMA throughout its investigation against the individuals. The matter relates to events in 2015.

EROAD is also considering bringing civil claims against both individuals for breach of confidence. 

Mr Bushby said the suspension and possibility of civil claims were part of a response to what appeared to be a serious breach of confidentiality, terms of employment, and the company’s code of ethics.

 “Irrespective of the FMA action, we are taking appropriate disciplinary action regarding the alleged sharing of confidential financial information for personal share trading,” he said. “We accord the security of our company information the highest priority.”

Mr Bushby said that the company had been disappointed to learn about the alleged actions of two individuals that led to the FMA’s proceedings.  “As a listed company we take our responsibilities very seriously and ensure that all our team has training and information to understand their obligations, the importance and consequences of insider trading laws and our own responsibilities.

 “We regard our values, ethics and integrity as a company as critically important and we strive to maintain the highest standards,” said Mr Bushby. 

He said that in reviewing the substantial amount of information that the company had provided the FMA to assist it in its investigation against the individuals, EROAD was confident that no data about staff, suppliers, customers or stakeholders had been compromised.

 “The information relating to this matter concerns EROAD historic financial information allegedly used for personal share trading,” he said. 

“While this is nonetheless a serious matter, we can assure our stakeholders that we remain vigilant with respect to protecting the integrity of our customer-facing systems and all third party data.”

He said that the company would be making no comment on the FMA’s proceedings, which were matters before the courts. Questions on this matter should be addressed to the FMA.

Summary
• EROAD supports and endorses the FMA’s commitment to the integrity of the capital markets in New Zealand, and EROAD has fully co-operated with and assisted the FMA throughout its investigation against the individuals.
• Staff training and information on the disclosure of confidential information and share trading is provided recurrently.  Adherence to strict confidentiality requirements is a condition of employment at EROAD.
• The FMA announcement relates to actions taken by two individuals in September 2015, and EROAD’s conduct is not the subject of investigation.  The FMA alleges that the former employee traded 15,000 EROAD shares in this period.

A copy of the FMA media announcement is available at https://fma.govt.nz/news/media-releases/.

    Improving health and safety behind technology uptake
    11:18am,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Two of New Zealand’s leading companies are installing new, sophisticated in-vehicle technology in their transport fleets to further improve their management of health and safety.

Transport technology service provider EROAD will provide Kiwi companies Fulton Hogan and Waste Management NZ Limited with more than 4,500 EROAD in-vehicle units as the companies look to further improve their health and safety management.
  
“The EROAD system has delivered many benefits for Fulton Hogan from reducing our Road User Charges to monitoring truck idling times to reduce fuel costs,” said Fulton Hogan’s Mechanical Engineer Graham Eaton.
  
“EROAD’s addition of driver behaviour features to help improve driver safety made the decision to install EROAD’s technology in more of our fleet very easy.  As a business with more than 6,700 people on our team, it’s important we stay safe at all times,” he said.

“One of our key Health and Safety policies is to, ‘Set objectives and targets to manage, measure and improve our performance’. EROAD makes this measurement and management simple by interfacing with our existing systems,” said Mr Eaton.

Waste Management’s decision to install EROAD technology has also been motivated by the ability to use Health and Safety services, said Waste Management’s National Fleet Manager, Jitesh Singh.
    
“EROAD delivers a range of capabilities to improve driver safety from the electronic logbook, including providing accurate information regarding driver rest periods and the pre-start inspection programme, which helps our drivers identify vehicle faults before they become a problem,” said Mr Singh.

“The safety of our people, our customers and our communities is paramount to us and we continue to invest in technology like EROAD to improve safety outcomes,” he said.

EROAD CEO Steven Newman said developing a suite of health and safety services had been a feature of the company’s recent R&amp;D investment, including features such as driver behaviour and driver logbook as well as vehicle-focused services like the EROAD Inspect app.

Mr Newman said the market response to EROAD’s in-vehicle device Ehubo2, which enables customers to access its full suite of health and safety services, had been very positive. Around 4,300 units were now used by fleets throughout the company’s Established market of New Zealand and Australia, since the product’s launch a year ago. 

In particular, being able to use EROAD’s data from a large population of drivers and vehicles enabled customers to benchmark against industry ‘norms’ and to reward good driving to improve performance. 

“Our customers tell us that benefits to health and safety management are a strong motivator to use our services, alongside economic benefits, like lower maintenance costs and improved fuel economy.”

Executive Chairman’s Interim Report 2017

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Delegat Group Limited, I am pleased to present its operating and financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2016. 

Performance Highlights
- Record Global Case Sales of 1,446,000.
- Record Operating NPAT of $24.7 million.
- Capital investment of $21.9 million in growth assets including vineyard development and the Hawke's Bay and Marlborough Wineries.
- Oyster Bay received the 'Hot Brand' award from New York's highly regarded Impact Magazine for a seventh consecutive year.
- Barossa Valley Estate Shiraz 2014 and Grenache Shiraz Mourvedre 2014 were both awarded 90 Points by James Halliday, Australia’s leading wine writer. 
- Delegat Crownthorpe Terraces Chardonnay 2015 received a Gold Medal at the New Zealand International Wine Show 2016.

The Group presents its financial statements in accordance with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS).  The Directors continue to be of the view that the results reported under NZ IFRS do not provide adequate insight into the Group’s underlying operational performance, primarily due to a number of fair value adjustments that are required to be reported on.  To better understand the operating performance, the Group has published an Operating Performance report and reconciliation of Operating Profit to Reported Profit. This reconciliation eliminates from each line in the Statement of Financial Performance all fair value adjustments.   

Operating Performance
A record Operating NPAT of $24.7 million was generated compared to $21.1 million for the same period the previous year.  Operating EBIT of $41.4 million is $7.6 million higher than for the same period the previous year.  

Delegat achieved Operating Revenue of $135.8 million on global case sales of 1,446,000 in the six month period. Revenue is up $7.2 million on the same period last year due to a 14% increase in global case sales, partially offset by the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.

Operating Gross Margin is up 6% on the same period last year and is impacted by lower cost of goods per case arising from the higher yielding 2016 vintage.   Operating Expenses at $35.3 million are $2.9 million lower than the same period last year.  This is due to the impact of a stronger New Zealand currency on the translation of off-shore expenditure.

NZ IFRS Fair Value adjustments
In accordance with NZ IFRS the Group is required to account for certain of their assets at fair value rather than at historic cost.  All movements in these fair values are reflected in and impact the Statement of Financial Performance.  The Group records adjustments in respect of two significant items at the half-year reporting date: 
• Harvest Provision Release (Grapes) – Inventory is valued at market value, rather than costs incurred, at harvest.  Any fair value adjustment is excluded from Operating Performance for the year, by creating a Harvest Provision.  This Harvest Provision is then released through Cost of Sales when inventory is sold in subsequent years. The adjustment provides a write-down of $8.3 million (December 2015: $4.8 million);
• Derivative Instruments held to hedge the Group’s foreign currency and interest rate exposure. The mark-to-market movement of these instruments at balance date resulted in a fair value write-up of $0.6 million (December 2015: $5.4 million).
These together with minor adjustments in respect of share-based payments, net of taxation, amount to a write-down of $5.6 million (December 2015: write-up of $0.4 million).

 
Cash Flow
The Group generated Cash Flows from Operations of $24.9 million in the current half-year, which is an increase of $9.8 million on the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher receipts from customers due to the higher cases sales. A total of $23.0 million was invested in additional property, plant and equipment during the period, including vineyard development in New Zealand and the Barossa Valley, and development of the Hawke's Bay and Marlborough wineries, which will provide earnings growth into the years ahead. The Group distributed $12.1 million to shareholders in dividends. Additional borrowings of $10.3 million were drawn down to fund the increased capital investment during the six months.
The Group has Net Debt of $292.0 million, compared to $282.7 million at 30 June 2016 – an increase of 3% and well within the Group's long term bank debt facilities.

Looking Forward
The results achieved in the six months to December 2016 are testament to the strength of the Group's business model. Delegat Group is well positioned to pursue its strategic goal to build a leading global Super Premium wine company.. The Group is on target to achieve global case sales for the full year of 2,632,000, up 9% on last year.  The Group continues to face risks in the form of exchange rate volatility, which makes it difficult to forecast financial performance.  Based on the prevailing exchange rates, the Group forecasts a 2017 operating profit result in line with last year's record performance.

    Comvita Updates Previous Guidance 
    10:01am,  5 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  Comvita announced today that the two major downside risks communicated in our previous market announcements of 23 January and 21 February 2017 have both come to bear, and we now expect that the direct impact of these two situations will result in an after tax operating loss for the financial year ended 30 June 2017, in the order of $7m.  Reported net profit after tax is now expected to be approximately $9m after including the sale of Medihoney IP and shares in Derma Sciences, Inc.
 
Trading conditions over the last two months in its two largest markets (Australia and New Zealand) have not recovered in line with our earlier expectations.  For forecast purposes, in terms of this June year financial result, we are now assuming that the informal channels out of Australia and New Zealand into China will not recover to our earlier forecast levels before 30 June 2017.  To exacerbate the financial impact of this sales downturn, continued poor weather has further reduced the production of honey for the 2016-2017 season.  

Comvita CEO Scott Coulter, said, “Although the informal trade channels will show growth over the previous half year this is still well under our previous expectations, and much of these sales to China have been satisfied by inventory held within the various channels to market. Our distribution strategy, both online and offline continues to provide our consumers the ability to connect and engage directly with our brand. We believe that when the channel has been fully ‘de-stocked’ that we should see both ‘sell in’ and ‘sell through’ and as a consequence a return to much improved financial performance”.

“The commencement of operation of our China distribution Joint Venture on 1 July 2017 is an important stepping stone to getting closer to our customers in China, and to be able to have more influence over our brand. We measure our brand health regularly and our key metrics inside China of Awareness, Trial and Frequency of Use have improved over the previous period. Our navigation of the changing trading environment in mainland China continues to be a main focus to management as we look to enhance all channels to market”.

Comvita Chairman Neil Craig, said “With respect to our apiary business, it’s quite straight forward in beekeeping, you spend money with the objective of collecting honey. If there is no honey then you will still incur the costs.  It’s a core part of our planning to mitigate against regional weather events by having hives located in strategic locations around the country, said Mr Craig but we can’t mitigate against poor weather across the whole country.” Mr Craig stressed as per Comvita’s previous guidance that this harvest was seen as a one off, with some experts saying it was a 1 in 20 year event. Given the nature of the 2016-2017 honey harvest and the fact that Comvita has significant levels of inventory, the extremely poor season is unlikely to impact future profitability.   
 
“In summary, while the simultaneous impact of two very significant events in one financial year is ‘tough to stomach’, the Comvita business model remains sound.  We have focused on productivity and cost saving initiatives across the business and we have already implemented significant permanent overhead cost reductions.  At the same time, as part of our diversification strategy we will deliver significant new market, channel and product innovation initiatives this year which will underpin our sales increase in the second half year and sets us up well for FY18.  Given an average honey harvest in 2017-2018, we remain on track to deliver our medium and longer term strategic objectives beyond what has been a very challenging period of time for the company.”  

Ends.

    FY17 earnings guidance update
    8:30am,  7 Feb 2017 | FORECAST
  

  The Board of Directors of Cavalier Corporation advises that the normalised profit after tax for the 16/17 year is now forecast to be close to break-even, below the $3.0 to $5.0 million normalised profit after tax guidance given to the market in November last year.

The reduction in forecast reflects difficult trading conditions in Australia and an increasingly depressed wool market.

Market conditions in Australia appear to be weakening, with very soft trading in December and January resulting in a revision of Australian sales volumes for the next six months.  Weaker Australian economic conditions have also pushed up the NZD/AUD cross rate, another factor adversely impacting on the forecast revision. However, the Company’s belief in Australia as a key market, where opportunities for growth are significant, remains unchanged.

While the recent significant drop in the wool price is good for Cavalier in the longer term, the depressed wool market impacts volumes through the newly-merged scouring operation and the profitability of our wool buying business in the short term. The duration of China’s reduced demand for wool is uncertain.

This year, Cavalier has invested heavily in consolidating its manufacturing operations and reinvigorating its brand. We have introduced new products late in the last calendar year and began updating and modernising our in-store presence and consumer-facing marketing material. These investments will deliver improved results in the 17/18 year. The significantly reduced wool price and higher NZD/USD exchange rate on the cost of carpet manufacturing will also benefit the results. Improved returns from the merged scouring operation are also expected to flow into the 17/18 year as synergies are progressively realised from the consolidation of operations.

In summary, the 16/17 year is a year of investment, consolidation and restructuring.  We are confident that the benefits of the work done this year and changes in the macro environment will flow through into improved results in future years.

    Preliminary announcement of December 2016 half year results
    9:35am, 17 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  Directors’ Report
For the six months ended 31 December 2016

The half-year results reported today are in line with what the Directors expected when they recently announced that the normalised profit after tax for the 2016/17 year is forecast to be close to break-even.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Consolidated Income Statement
Six months ended 31 December
Unaudited
(figures in 000's for six months ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015)

Revenue $84,278; $98,422

EBIT (Normalised) (1) (1,183); 4,268
Net interest expense (1,489); (1,961)
Share of equity-accounted investee profit (Normalised after tax) (1) 88; 985
Profit/(Loss) before tax (Normalised) (1) (2,584); 3,292
Income tax 708; (876)
Profit/(Loss) after tax (Normalised) (1) (1,876); 2,416
Restructuring costs (1,833); (936)
Net gain on merger of equity-accounted investee 3,740; 0
Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment 0; 2,035
Profit after tax (GAAP) $31; $3,515

Earnings per share (cents) (Normalised) (1) (2.7); 3.5

Earnings per share (cents) (GAAP) 0.0; 5.1

(1) Normalised is a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) measure that provides what the Directors believe to be a more meaningful view of the underlying financial performance of the Group. A reconciliation between GAAP and normalised earnings together with further commentary on the disclosure of non-GAAP financial information are attached.

Last year’s focus was debt reduction, inventory rationalisation and the restructuring of administration and sales functions.  Our focus in recent months has been significant investment in the core business by consolidating manufacturing activities and re-invigorating the Cavalier Bremworth brand.

The short term cost of these essential reinvestment activities has impacted the current half year results, however they will progressively and significantly benefit the Company going forward. Other market factors such as increased wool price and the stronger USD have also adversely impacted the first half results.

The Group reports a break-even position for the half year (compared with $3.5m in 2015/16). Adjusting for the abnormal gain from the scour merger of $3.7m and transitional costs relating to the consolidation of Cavalier’s wool spinning operation of $1.8m, the normalised loss for the first six months is $1.9m compared with a normalised gain of $2.4m last financial year.

FINANCIAL POSITION

The increase in net bank debt of $5.9m since the year-end reflects $6.0m of restructuring costs and $2.1m capital gains tax payment resulting from the sale of the Sydney warehouse in the last financial year. With these large one-off costs now behind us, debt will once again start to fall. In January, the Company received a dividend of $3.25m from Cavalier Wool Holdings Ltd (CWH) as a result of the scour merger, which has reduced debt.

In the last six months, management has improved the Company’s inventory profile and reduced inventory by $8.5m. This has been achieved while it was also manufacturing the additional inventory required to support new products in the market.

Total assets and equity have remained in line with previous year-end.

CASH FLOWS

Net cash outflows from operations were $4.8m for the first six months, reflecting the large costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing and the capital gains tax payment referred to above.

SEGMENT REVIEWS

Carpet Business

The sale of the Ontera carpet tile business in 2015/16 and the associated carpet tile revenue forgone is the main driver of the fall in revenue.

The NZ market has remained reasonably buoyant, however Australia has been much softer than anticipated particularly in the last two months.  We are working hard with our retailers to stimulate sales.

We have now closed our Christchurch plant and moved the felting operation to Wanganui. Woollen yarn spinning is now conducted entirely out of the Napier plant. We acknowledge the management and staff of these operations for making this happen.

The carpet segment result for the first six months has been affected by a number of factors including:

• Significant restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of spinning operations;
• Higher wool price compared with the previous year;
• Higher USD impacting negatively on cost of synthetic yarn purchases; and
• Increased marketing costs in respect of the new Cavalier Bremworth World of Difference marketing campaign.

All of the above factors that have negatively impacted the six months (and the full year forecast) will either not repeat or have turned in our favour, with the benefits to come through in 2017/18.The significant gains from consolidating our manufacturing operations will also be progressively realised in the 2017/18 year.

Because there is about a six month lag between the purchase of wool and the manufacture and sale of carpet, we will not see the benefit from the current drop in wool price until 2017/18. Conversely, the high wool price that prevailed in the previous year is adversely impacting current profitability.

Wool Business

Our wool business comprises our wool buying operation, Elco Direct, and a 27.5% interest in the enlarged CWH wool scouring business post its merger with the wool scouring operations of New Zealand Wool Services International Ltd (NZWSI). This is to be compared with the 50% we held previously in a smaller pre-merger entity.

This year, both our wool-related businesses have been adversely impacted by the dramatic drop in wool price which has caught many in the industry by surprise and is due almost entirely to a lack of demand out of China.

Elco Direct, like many wool traders and exporters, had to exit stocks in a falling market and this impacted negatively on margins. The current price of wool is very low and growers are reluctant to sell at these levels.  As a result, the flow of wool has abated significantly, with a high percentage of wool passed in at auction.  Elco Direct has had three very strong years, but profits are down in the last six months reflecting the current challenging operating environment.  Once demand returns and wool price stabilises, Elco Direct will be in a better position to buy and sell wool at a consistent margin.

After over two years of Court proceedings, the merger of CWH with the wool scouring operations of NZWSI was finally approved by the Court of Appeal in December. The purpose of the merger is to safeguard the wool scouring industry in New Zealand and our reduced share in a much bigger entity will be beneficial for the Company in the long term.

For the first six months, volume through the scour is considerably down on that for the same period last year.  The total wool clip has not changed dramatically, but at current low prices, growers and exporters are holding off committing to selling and scouring wool. We are confident that the wool will eventually come on to market and be scoured once pricing and demand settle at their new levels.

The consolidation of the scouring businesses is expected to take a year to complete. In the short term, CWH will experience some inefficiencies while equipment is being moved and reconfigured.

EARNINGS OUTLOOK

The Directors reiterate that their forecast for 2016/17 remains unchanged. We expect the result for 2016/17 to be close to breakeven on a normalised tax-paid basis.

2016/17 is a year of investment in the long term future of the Company, and we remain confident that the benefits of the work done this year together with changes in the macro environment will flow through into improved results. 

DIVIDENDS

The Directors have previously advised that as soon as we are in a position to confirm an ongoing improvement in underlying performance and we have our debt firmly under control, we will resume dividend payments. While good progress has been made, we are not there yet. The NZD:AUD exchange rate and the weakness in the Australian economy remain a concern to Cavalier as an exporter. As a consequence, no dividend is being paid at this time.

    Waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3
    8:37am, 20 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Regulation Decision
CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) 
Application for waiver from NZX Main Board Listing Rule 5.2.3

Decision
1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants CDI a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares for a period of twelve months to allow CDI to have fewer than 25% of its ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.CDI clearly and prominently discloses this waiver, its conditions, and its implications in CDI’s half-year and annual reports, and in any offer documents relating to any offer of shares undertaken by CDI, during the period of the waiver;
b.CDI notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the percentage of ordinary shares held by Members of the Public; and
c.CDI consistently monitors the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public and provides NZXR with a written quarterly update of the percentage of shares held by Members of the Public. The quarterly updates are from the date the waiver is granted, for the period of the waiver. The updates are to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter.
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
Reasons
5.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.NZXR previously granted a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 to CDI in March 2016 [2016 Waiver] for a period of 12 months, which allowed for Members of the Public to hold less than 25% of CDI’s ordinary shares; 
c.as at 28 February 2017, CDI has approximately 2,793 shareholders who are Members of the Public, holding approximately 23.2% of the ordinary shares. NZXR has considered CDI’s trading data over the period of the 2016 Waiver, and  is satisfied that CDI will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
d.CDI meets the requirement that 500 Members of the Public hold at least a Minimum Holding;
e.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, CDI would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares. CDI submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of CDI and its Directors;
f.holders of the ordinary shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, CDI has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;
g.the condition contained in paragraph 2(a) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the ordinary shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the ordinary shares, of this waiver and its implications for the ordinary shares;
h.the conditions contained in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in CDI’s spread over the period of the waiver; 
i.the waiver is granted for a period of twelve months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the ordinary shares in twelve months’ time if CDI considers a waiver is still required; and
j.there is precedent for this decision.
 
Appendix One
1.CDL Investments New Zealand Limited (CDI) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board.
2.On 22 March 2016, CDI was granted a waiver for a period of twelve months from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its ordinary shares, allowing CDI to have fewer than 25% of the ordinary shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.As at 28 February 2016, CDI has approximately 2,797 shareholders who are Members of the Public holding 23.2% of the ordinary shares.  
4.CDI has applied to renew the 2016 Waiver in respect of their ordinary shares for a period of twelve months.
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities 
Rule 5.2.3 A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

    Half Year Results to 31 Dec 2016 and Interim Dividend
    8:30am,  8 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  FLIWAY GROUP LIMITED

Financial Results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 (Unaudited)

OVERVIEW - BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS

Stronger performance from the Business Development teams in both the Domestic and International divisions meant revenue for 1H17 was down year on year by only 1.4% despite the customer loss announced in June 2016. The December month's revenue was 5% ahead of last year as the new customer wins and existing customer uptrades delivered a strong revenue finish to the first half of FY17. Further customer contract  wins with commencement dates in 2017 have seen us secure additional capacity in both Transport and Warehousing.

Fliway Group performance was impacted by the customer loss. As indicated at the time, it was expected the EBITDA impact could appropximate 10% of Fliway's historical EBITDA performance and this has been reflected in the 1H17 results. Issues additionally impacting the business have been capacity constraints in the Transport business unit as a result of internal linehaul equipment availablility and the Kaikoura earthquake, which transferred significant rail freight volumes onto road, thereby consuming capacity overflow options over a peak trading period. Customer volumes, particularly in the second quarter, exceeded the network capacity in Transport.

Additional work was gained through the wider relationship with UPS and a number of initiatives were undertaken in the UPS-Fliway joint venture to lower the cost of package delivery in New Zealand, in order to create a more competitive international destination offering and facilitate higher levels of import package growth moving forward.

DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE

Domestic Division
Transport volume levels for the six months to December were ahead of last year as a result of the excellent business development work in that division that has seen new accounts either trading or signed, approximating $5 million in annualised new revenue. The higher freight volumes in the Transport business unit have seen Fliway operating outside its network capacity, requiring short term supplementary capacity solutions that have come at a cost premium due largely to that capacity being consumed by the consequences of the Kaikoura earthquake which significantly increased the road freight task as rail freight was disabled.

Internally, the Transport business unit implemented cost initiatives as a result of anticipated lower volumes that reduced capacity, at a time when new business and customer uptrades saw volumes increase ahead of last years levels. This short term capacity shortfall created cost issues that will have more economic solutions implemented against them in the future.

In the Logistics business unit, warehousing revenues were slightly down on last year, with strong cost management delivering a comparable profit result to last year. As a result of the business development wins in the domestic division, Fliway will be increasing warehouse capacity in Auckland by a further 6,000 square metres, or approx. 20%, in quarter 3 to accommodate the new growth. 

The roll out of the new Warehouse Management System is progressing well and will deliver productivity gains once  fully implemented.

International Division
EBITDA for the division was in line with last year, as a result of strong customer focus and good results from the business development team in winning new customers. The first half of FY17 saw significant changes in Flway International, with management changes, a continuation of low sea freight rates and some customer churn. The management team of the division has been re-organised and is performing well under the new leadership, strengthening relationships with network partners, customers and carriers.

As part of the customer focus initiatives in International, progress is being made on creating improved technological solutions to deliver for customers improved data and visibilty whilst at the same time moving to a paperless environment with improved workflow.

UPS-Fliway Joint Venture
In 1H17 import packages handled by the joint venture grew on the prior year by 13% and with a more competitive import cost, the expectation is to further grow these import volumes to produce higher financial returns in the future. The contribution from the UPS-Fliway joint venture was down on last year, with NPAT down by $0.155 million, as a result of a strategy designed to improve the cost of delivering a package in New Zealand in order to drive continued import package growth. 

GROUP CASHFLOWS AND DEBT

Operating cashflows were $1.1 million compared to the prior year's half figure of $3.0 million, as a result of the lower earnings and an increase in working capital levels by $1.2 million.  The higher revenues in December 2016 pushed debtor levels and with lower payables saw net working capital lift on the prior year, with the intention to manage this position back to historical levels, subject to continued revenue growth.

Net capital expenditure for the half year was $1.6 million, with $1.3 million of that spend relating to truck expenditure as Fliway returns to a more normal vehicle replacement cycle. The prior year FY16 truck spend was suppressed due to the significant fleet refresh in FY15 ahead of the NZX listing.

Fliway debt levels at 31 December 2016 were $8.8 million as compared to a bank facility of $18 million and represent 
1.5 times EBITDA, ensuring the balance sheet gearing still allows room for growth.

DIVIDEND

Consistent with prospectus and historical guidance with respect to the percentage of NPAT payable and the weighting between the first half and second half earnings, Fliway's Directors have approved the payment of an interim ordinary dividend of 2.0 cents per share. The dividends are payable on 20 April 2017 to shareholders recorded on the share register as at 5:00pm (New Zealand time) on 31 March 2017.

OUTLOOK

The first half reflects a perid of change in the business and a re-positioning for future growth. Transport capacity, margins and cost management remain priorities for the Group in order to convert the significant new customer wins in 1H17 into improved profitability in 2H17.

The balance sheet and declared dividend remain conservative to ensure capacity exists in whatever form required to convert the strong sales pipeline into improved future earnings.

Sales growth remains a focus for the Group as Fliway looks to sell to capacity in it's network and increase relationships with existing customers and business partners. 1H17 volumes finished the year strongly and with significant new customer wins still to come on board, it is our expectation that current momentum will be continued, giving us confidence that 2H17 will deliver improved results over the prior year.

    Malaysian Government Orders 23 Sealegs Craft
    8:35am, 29 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Future Mobility Solutions [NZX: FMS]
Subsidiary: Sealegs International Ltd, Tuesday 29th of March:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wholly owned FMS subsidiary, Sealegs International Limited, today announced it has received an order of 23 additional Sealegs amphibious craft to be supplied to the Malaysian Civil Defence Force. 
This follows from the proven use of existing Sealegs craft in operation in Malaysia, across a range of government sectors for both security and first-response. The multi-unit order is worth in excess of NZD$3 million and all 23 Sealegs craft will be due for delivery over the next 12 months.

Sealegs CEO David McKee Wright said “This is the largest single order for amphibious craft in the history of Sealegs. It evidences our strong relationship with the Malaysian Government and the already proven performance of Sealegs as first-response and emergency rescue craft. He went on to say “an order of this size will help our operating position over the next 12 months and set a precedent for other international government departments”.
The Sealegs application in Malaysia will be multi-faceted. With the amphibious craft’s primary purpose to be flood response, outside the flood-prone monsoon season the just-ordered Sealegs will join the existing fleet stationed across 33 locations around the country’s coastline providing emergency rescue services.

    Infratil Investor Day 2017
    8:39am, 29 Mar 2017 | ADDRESS
  

  Infratil has released the presentation material for its annual Investor Day attended by major shareholders, fund managers, broker analysts, regulatory agencies, business partners and commentators.

Infratil has a clear strategy for providing good risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders over the long-term. It invests in sectors with powerful growth characteristics where there are opportunities for expertise and excellent management to create shareholder value.

Air travel, decarbonisation of energy and transport, accommodation and care for the elderly, electronic data storage, urban mobility, student accommodation, and residential utilities; are all themes underlying Infratil investments. 

The presentations highlight the focus on deploying capital in the newly established platforms of renewables, eldercare and data infrastructure, alongside ongoing performance improvements in Infratil’s core assets. Key presentations this year from Infratil’s newer businesses; Longroad, Tilt, RetireAustralia and Canberra Data Centres; show how they are taking advantage of their sector’s growth to create value. Also covered is how generation-retailing in the New Zealand electricity market can deliver satisfactory returns given low demand growth and regulatory interventions.

Each business will discuss its growth initiatives and areas of high confidence and relative uncertainty. The management approach is illustrated by Longroad and Tilt. On the one hand both the USA and Australia will continue to decarbonise their energy sectors with efficient renewable capacity, on the other hand political and regulatory noise has reduced near-term transparency. Longroad and Tilt’s response is logical and prudent; create options.  

Canberra Data Centres was Infratil's largest ever new investment, reflecting management’s high conviction of the sector and CDC's positioning. Even since Infratil agreed to acquire its 48% shareholding, the sector’s evolution seems to have accelerated. CDC offers its clients a unique ecosystem and a differentiated package of data security, accessibility and reliability. 

Infratil remains committed to its goal of increasing its dividends, which remains on track given the outlook for the year ended 31 March 2017.

Preliminary guidance has also been provided for the 2018 financial year.

The 2018 guidance assumes EBITDAF contribution from existing businesses, which may change over the year if further divestments or investments occur. Cash flow, interest and non-cash costs are also predicated on the same status quo assumption.

For the purposes of Listing Rules 5.2.5 and 7.12.1 of the NZX Main Board Listing Rules, Heartland Bank Limited (Heartland) advises that the following securities have been issued to certain institutional investors:

Class of Security: Subordinated unsecured convertible notes (Notes).  The Notes are not quoted on the NZX Debt Market. If a non-viability trigger event occurs, the Notes will convert into fully paid ordinary shares in Heartland  (Conversion)

ISIN: AU3FN0035416

Number of Notes issued: 20,000

Nominal value (if any): A$10,000 per Note

Issue price: A$10,000 per Note and A$20,000,000 in aggregate for all Notes

Payment: Cash

Amount paid up: Fully paid up

Percentage of total class issued: 100% of the total number of Notes

Principal terms of the Notes: Refer to the Term Sheet accompanying this notice. 

Reason for issue: Approximately 72% of the face value of the Notes will be recognised as Tier 2 Capital, a type of regulatory capital, for Heartland. The proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be used for Heartland's general corporate purposes. 

Specific authority for issue: The Notes are issued pursuant to a Deed Poll dated 31 March 2017. The issue was approved by a resolution of the board of directors of Heartland.  

Terms or details of issue: Refer to the Term Sheet accompanying this notice.

Total number of Notes after issue: 20,000

Treasury stock (for acquisition only): Not applicable

Date of issue: 7 April 2017

Additional information: If a non-viability trigger event occurs, Conversion will occur immediately and without prior notice to the market.  
There is no cap on the number of ordinary shares in Heartland (HBL Shares) that can be issued by Heartland on Conversion.  This means Conversion is potentially dilutionary for existing holders of HBL Shares.  The level of potential dilution for existing holders of HBL Shares will depend on the price of HBL Shares and the spot NZ$/A$ exchange rate at the time of Conversion.

Genesis Energy is rewarding its customers by joining New Zealand’s leading and most popular loyalty programme, Fly Buys.

“Loyalty is a two-way street, and offering Fly Buys points to loyal customers will be our way of showing our appreciation for customers. By joining up with Fly Buys we will be offering the most popular and easy-to-use reward scheme the country has to offer.

“We’re really excited to be offering the Fly Buys benefits for customers including, for the first time, Fly Buys points on dual fuel bills for electricity and bottled gas.”

To celebrate joining Fly Buys, Genesis Energy is preparing an early-bird offer to our existing customers and any other household that uses electricity, natural gas or bottled gas (45kg LPG) and wants to continue to receive Fly Buys on their energy purchases.

An opportunity to pre-register for an  early bird offer will be made available  before 7 May, the date when Fly Buys and Genesis Energy come together to offer reward points.

Fly Buys is New Zealand’s favourite loyalty programme with more than 2.5 million members in 74% of households.  Members can collect points from over 1,500 outlets and spend them in the Fly Buys store on a range of over 4,000 rewards, or on any Air New Zealand flight.

HALF YEAR REVIEW
From the Chairman and Managing Director

The Directors are pleased to present the consolidated financial result of Freightways Limited (Freightways) for the half year ended 31 December 2016. This report discusses the result, reviews the operations of each division and provides an outlook for the financial year ending 30 June 2017. 

Highlights include the strength of the underlying volume growth and margin in the express package &amp; business mail division, progress to timetable and budget of establishing major purpose-built facilities in Sydney and Christchurch and the related relocation projects, the execution of robust contingency plans that ensured minimal service disruption following the significant impact of the North Canterbury earthquake and the performance of our information management businesses, other than TIMG Australia, which was primarily affected by a poor result at LitSupport. 

Operating performance

The below table (refer attachments) presents the reported half year result compared to the prior comparative period (pcp), both before and after the inclusion of non-recurring items:

$ million - December 2016 Result before non-recurring items; Non-recurring items; December 2016 Result after non-recurring items; December 2015 Result; Increase %

Revenue: 272.8; -; 272.8; 254.9; 7.0%
EBITDA(i): 55.8; 4.0; 51.8; 51.2; 1.2%
EBITA(ii): 50.1; 4.0; 46.1; 45.0; 2.4%
NPATA(iii): 34.8; 4.5; 30.3; 28.7; 5.6%
NPAT(iv): 34.0; 4.5; 29.5; 27.7; 6.2%
EPS(cents): 21.9; 2.9; 19.0; 17.9; 6.1%

Notes:
i. Operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
ii. Operating profit before interest, tax, and amortisation. 
iii. Net profit after tax (NPAT), before amortisation. 
iv. Profit for the half year attributable to shareholders.
 
The results discussed throughout this commentary exclude the impact of the following non-recurring items that the Directors believe should not be included when assessing the underlying half year trading results:
• A non-recurring benefit before tax of $5.6 million relating to previously accrued final acquisition payments that are no longer expected to be required. The interim dividend was calculated excluding this non-cash benefit. 
• A non-recurring cost before tax of $1.6 million relating to the relocation of the TIMG business in Sydney.  
 
Dividend

The Directors have declared an interim dividend of 13 cents per share, fully imputed at a tax rate of 28%, being a 2% increase above the pcp dividend of 12.75 cents per share. This represents a payout of approximately $20.1 million compared with $19.7 million for the pcp dividend. The dividend will be paid on 3 April 2017. The record date for determination of entitlements to the dividend is 17 March 2017.

The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will not be offered in relation to this dividend. As a capital management tool, the application of the DRP will be reviewed for each future dividend.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

Divisional results for the half year ended 31 December 2016 are provided below for the express package &amp; business mail division and the information management division. 

Express Package &amp; Business Mail

Operating revenue of $202.5 million was 8% higher than the pcp. EBITA of $34.8 million was 7% higher than the pcp. 

The express package &amp; business mail division operates a multi-brand strategy in the domestic market through New Zealand Couriers, Post Haste, Castle Parcels, NOW Couriers, SUB60, Security Express, Kiwi Express, Stuck, Pass The Parcel, DX Mail and Dataprint.

Volume and revenue growth throughout the half year was strong, particularly so in the peak December month. Increased activity amongst existing customers and the winning of new customers contributed to this growth. Disruption surcharges were introduced during December to offset increased linehaul and delivery costs following November’s North Canterbury earthquake. Overall, costs have been well contained and the higher operating costs involved with the transition to a new aircraft operating model reduced through the second quarter. Key matters:

• The transition to Boeing 737-400 aircraft is progressing well. The four superseded freighter aircraft owned by FRE have all been sold for their combined book value of $1 million. Three of the aircraft were sold subsequent to the end of the half year. The Boeing 737-400 aircraft provided important capacity during the peak volume period leading into Christmas.  
• The new airside facility currently being constructed at Christchurch airport is on schedule. This facility will be automated with physical conveyor equipment, which is currently being assembled on site, and IT developed collaboratively by Freightways’ IT team and the European-based suppliers. Overall this project is running to budget expectations. 
• Increased resourcing of the IT team has enabled the progression of a number of key projects in support of Freightways’ strategic intent to be a technology leader in the markets it operates in.  
• The North Canterbury earthquake had a significant impact on the division’s inter-island and intra-South Island linehaul services. Providing a consistent nationwide overnight and two-day delivery service relies on the network operating to a strict timetable. An issue at one point in the linehaul system has a ripple effect throughout the entire network and if not addressed, will severely affect customers who are reliant on the performance of this service. Immediately following the earthquake, the businesses developed a contingency plan to address the loss of State Highway One in the upper South Island and the initially disrupted inter-islander ferries to ensure the least possible impact on customers. This plan required the deployment of several additional linehaul trucks, drivers and depot handling staff at key sortation hubs throughout the country. The teamwork and passion displayed by Freightways’ people to provide the best possible service in working through this significant challenge was and remains outstanding. Likewise, the support of customers during this period is acknowledged and appreciated. 
 
Freightways’ business mail operator, DX Mail, further expanded its postie network and now businesses in most urban locations throughout New Zealand are able to choose DX Mail for overnight and 5-day per week delivery of their standard-priced letters. Despite the decline of the overall physical letter market, the demand for DX Mail’s suite of services is increasing. Dataprint, which provides physical and digital transactional mailhouse services, increased market share in all of its service lines, both physical and digital. 

Information Management  

Operating revenue of $71.1 million was 3% higher than the pcp. EBITA of $13.4 million was 6% lower than the pcp.

The information management division operates under the brands of The Information Management Group (TIMG) and Shred-X.

Strong results from Shred-X and TIMG New Zealand were primarily offset by poor performance from TIMG Australia’s LitSupport business, which led to some restructuring and related costs. Key matters:

• LitSupport has performed at the bottom end of the range of expectations set at the time of acquiring the business. While forecast revenue growth has been achieved, forecast EBITDA growth has not occurred. This outcome was anticipated as a possibility at that time and hence the payment for this business was structured to reduce Freightways’ financial risk should this occur. As previously announced, the vendors of LitSupport refunded A$5 million of the initial A$17.1 million purchase price in March 2016. Based on the forecast for the current year, the effective multiple of EBITDA applicable to the reduced purchase price remains at approximately the same level as originally expected. This has, however, meant that an earn-out payment of $5.3 million previously accrued is not now anticipated to be paid to the vendors and accordingly it has been written back to the income statement as a non-cash, non-recurring benefit. Recent restructuring of LitSupport and the winning of a number of new contracts is expected to assist in improving LitSupport’s performance over time.
• During the prior year, it was announced that Freightways would invest in the relocation of three Sydney-based information management facilities into a single purpose-built facility. The cost of this relocation has at this stage been $1.6 million of the $2.5 million budget for this project and overall is tracking to budget expectations and timetable. Operating from a single site will deliver operating efficiencies that will contribute to a positive return on this investment from the completion of this project in June this year. 
• Demand for the digital services offered by TIMG and the e-destruction services offered by Shred-X continues to gain momentum. It is expected that these new revenue streams will become an increasingly important part of the overall information management division’s revenue and earnings in the near to medium term. 
• The severity of the North Canterbury earthquake had repercussions for the division’s document storage facilities in Wellington. While the racking did its job and withstood the impact of the earthquake, its structural integrity was compromised, particularly in the major site located in Porirua. This has resulted in the likelihood of having to repair or replace most, if not all, of the Porirua racking and will involve repositioning boxes while repairs are made or replacement racking is installed. Freightways carries comprehensive insurance for events such as this. The related deductible has been expensed as a corporate cost. Thanks to the strong service culture within the TIMG business, the quick actions of its people and the support of key suppliers, the service disruption to TIMG’s customers has been minimal. Again the support of customers during this period is acknowledged and appreciated.    
 
Internal service providers

Fieldair Holdings, through its subsidiary of Air Freight NZ, operates a joint venture company that leases and operates the Boeing 737-400 aircraft fleet that provides Freightways’ overnight airfreight linehaul service. Fieldair also provides specialist engineering and contracting services to the general aviation market. Parceline Express provides Freightways’ road linehaul service. As volumes have grown, the services provided by these businesses have adapted to ensure the provision of quality sustainable capacity. 

Freightways Information Services provides IT development and support to the express package &amp; business mail division. This team is responsible for providing the front line businesses with robust and secure information management systems and supporting their technology-related strategic objectives.   

Corporate 

Corporate costs have increased compared to the pcp, primarily due to expensing the insurance deductibles related to earthquake insurance claims. 

Net debt levels are unchanged from the pcp at $159 million. A finance facility has also been established with a US-based lender on the same terms as those that are in place with Freightways’ existing banking syndicate. 

Capital expenditure during the half year of $10 million, including the investment made in the new Christchurch and Sydney premises, has been funded from operating cash flows.

OUTLOOK

Volumes and activity evidenced in this first half result support Freightways’ expectations of again improving its overall year-on-year performance. The markets in which Freightways operates in both New Zealand and Australia remain positive and the company is experiencing increasing demand for the services it provides.  

As had been stated in the prior annual result announcement and as is evident in this half year announcement, results from the express package &amp; business mail division will be partly offset by the investment being made in increased capacity in the information management division to accommodate current and future expected growth and poor performance of LitSupport in this half year. Expectations are for improved performance from LitSupport in the second half of the financial year. 

The next six months will see the completion of the major projects that are underway to relocate the businesses in Sydney and Christchurch, with the full benefits relating to these projects on target to be realised in the 2018 financial year.

Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to be approximately $24 million. Overall cash flows are expected to remain strong for the remainder of the 2017 financial year.
    
Strategic growth opportunities, including acquisitions and alliances that complement existing capabilities, will be executed where they make commercial sense. 
 
CONCLUSION

The strength of the Freightways business models, the expertise of its people and the positive features of the markets it operates in are once again evident in this half year result.
 
The Directors acknowledge the outstanding work and ongoing dedication of the Freightways team of people throughout New Zealand and Australia.

  1 March 2017

Market Release, Auckland, New Zealand

Finzsoft Limited (NZX:FIN) Reports Preliminary Interim Financial Results for Half Year Ended 31 December 2016

Finzsoft is pleased to provide its half-year report for the 6 month period ended 31 December 2016 and announces its performance highlights for the half year ended 31 December 2016:

- Six month operating revenue of $10.38 million, which is consistent with the same six month period in the previous year (FY16 $10.37 million).

- Strong customer base supporting underlying, recurring, licence and services revenue.

- EBITDA result of $3.3 million driven by timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

- Continued profitability, no debt and positive cash flow.

- Net profit after tax has increased to $1.9 million, up from $208,000 for the same period last year (6 month period ended 31 December 2015), again largely due to timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

•    Continued profitability, no debt and positive cash flow.

• Net profit after tax has increased to $1.9 million, up from $208,000 for the same period last year (6 month period ended 31 December 2015), again largely due to timing of annual licence and initial licence fees from existing and new clients, and reduction in costs.

• Continued investment in sales and marketing to leverage and convert the opportunities in Asean brought about by the Silverlake investment.

Finzsoft is pleased to report its half-yearly earnings to 31 December 2016, continuing the company’s strong performance with continued investment in the company to set it up for long term sustainable growth in New Zealand, Australia and the wider Asean region.

Finzsoft Managing Director, Andrew Holliday said the continued expansion into the credit union market is exciting and builds on Finzsoft’s strong history of working with New Zealand’s credit unions and building societies. The proven track record of Finzsoft’s core banking software, Sovereign, which will run First Credit Union’s operations from customer service in the front end to all of the bank end operations, was critical to Finzsoft being chosen as the new partner for First Credit Union and Westforce Credit Union.

Based on current contracted revenue, along with our pipeline opportunities for our financial year ending 30 June 2017, we will expect to see Finzsoft continuing to operate profitably with no debt and positive cash flow. We have ongoing delivery to our key client work orders both in Australia and New Zealand”.

    IQE – Intueri to Exit Australia Early; Focus on NZ Schools
    8:30am, 24 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE

23 March 2017

IQE – INTUERI TO EXIT AUSTRALIA EARLY; FOCUS ON NEW ZEALAND SCHOOLS

• Intueri will cease operations in Australia on 29 March 2017. This has no impact on the Group’s New Zealand operations.
• The decision is in response to recent funding and regulatory developments which have had a material impact on the Australian operations, including the deregistration of two of Intueri’s Australian schools and notification that the 2016 request for an uplift in the VFH funding cap of $5.6m has been declined. 
• The Intueri Board is considering whether to appeal against the decision on the 2016 VFH funding cap uplift; and is continuing to seek VFH payments for 2014/2015 of A$0.14m and for 2017 of approximately A$0.5m for teach out of students undertaken to date. 
• Intueri has entered into a Standstill Agreement with its bank.

Listed vocational education provider, Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE), advises that it will cease operations in Australia on 29 March 2017. This decision has no impact on the Group’s New Zealand operations, which are run as a separate regional division and have confirmed funding in place. 

The decision by Intueri’s Board to close the Australian operations is in response to a number of recent developments including notification from the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) that it intends to cancel the registration of Intueri’s Australian colleges, Conwal &amp; Associates Pty Ltd and Online Courses Australia Pty Ltd. Intueri had planned to voluntarily deregister both colleges at the end of 2017, allowing it to teach out existing students or, where necessary, assist in the transfer of some students to other teaching institutions to finish their courses. This would have seen Intueri’s Australian colleges operate in a breakeven position for the rest of the year. The company has elected not to appeal ASQA’s decision, and will therefore cease the Australian operations on 29 March 2017. 

Intueri has also been advised that its application to the Department of Education and Training (DET) to reconsider a A$5.6m uplift in 2016 VET FEE-HELP (VFH) funding has been declined. The Board is considering whether to appeal this decision. In addition, Intueri has been advised that payment of any Q1 2017 VFH funding by the DET will be deferred until 1 April 2017 at the earliest.

Intueri is still seeking A$0.14m in outstanding VFH funding for 2014/2015, and will seek approximately A$0.5m in VFH funding for students taught in the 2017 calendar year to date. 

Intueri is very disappointed with this outcome, given that Intueri had a managed exit strategy in place which it believes would have been in the best interests of students and staff.  It is working closely with the industry body, ACPET, to assist in the transfer of students to alternative providers, and providing support to staff. 

The decision to exit Australia has no impact on Intueri’s New Zealand operations. Confirmed funding is in place for 2017 and management continue to focus on ensuring the ongoing provision of high quality vocational education from its New Zealand schools. 

As previously advised, the Board is assessing a number of capital restructuring and strategic options for the Group, including a potential divestment of businesses. Intueri has entered into a standstill agreement with its bank for the duration of the review. 

Intueri also advises that it has received the draft Deloitte report from the TEC’s investigation into Quantum. Intueri is currently reviewing the report and will provide a response by 20 April 2017 as requested.

    Kiwi Property portfolio value increases to $3 billion
    9:01am,  3 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Kiwi Property today reported a net increase of approximately $38 million (+1.3%) in the value of its portfolio of shopping centres and office buildings for the year ended 31 March 2017, with the total portfolio value lifting to $3.0 billion.

Chief Executive, Chris Gudgeon, said: “Kiwi Property’s portfolio has benefited from a general strengthening in investment market conditions with capitalisation rates firming to a record low across the portfolio. New leasing deals and strong sales at our key retail centres have assisted value growth, albeit our overall gain was moderated by our continued proactive approach to earthquake strengthening which effectively reduced the gain by approximately $22 million.”

The weighted average capitalisation rate for the portfolio firmed 21 basis points to 6.4% and the valuations indicate that, overall, the portfolio is marginally under-rented by 0.5%.

The March 2017 property valuations were determined by independent valuers and will be confirmed in the Company’s audited financial results for the year to 31 March 2017, to be announced on 22 May 2017.

RETAIL PORTFOLIO
 
The value of the retail portfolio increased to $2.0 billion and its weighted average capitalisation rate firmed 17 basis points to 6.52%. This represented a net value gain (after allowing for capital expenditure and IFRS adjustments) of approximately $8 million (+0.4%). 

Sylvia Park, the Company’s flagship asset, increased in value by $11 million (+1.5%) to $755 million. On completion of the office and dining lane developments now underway (requiring further expenditure of $75 million in remaining development costs), the value of Sylvia Park is projected to increase to $840 million. 
 

OFFICE PORTFOLIO

The net value gain for the office portfolio was approximately $22 million (+2.5%) with the portfolio value increasing to $879 million and the weighted average capitalisation rate firming 31 basis points to 6.13%.

Auckland office buildings provided a net value gain of $23 million, with capitalisation rates for both Vero Centre and ASB North Wharf firming to 5.75%. The increase in value of the Vero Centre is assisted by limited vacancy in the Prime-grade sector and higher market rents.

In Wellington, Kiwi Property’s core government precinct buildings, The Aurora Centre and 44 The Terrace, produced a combined $4 million of value uplift. The value of the Majestic Centre increased to $119.4 million but a net value loss of $5 million was recorded after allowing for capital expenditure on the seismic upgrade programme which completed in January.

The valuation summary as at 31 March 2017 has been provided to NZX.

    Amended Commentary – HY17 Interim Report
    3:09pm, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  There is an error in the second paragraph of the Financial Commentary relating to Cash Flow at page 11 of the 2017 Interim Report. 

The paragraph reads:

""The company elected to pre-pay some of its third provisional tax payment in March 2016, which would otherwise have been payable in July, to fully impute the 4 cents per share special dividend paid in September 2016.""

This paragraph should be replaced with the following:

""The company elected to pre-pay some of its third provisional tax payment in March 2016, which would otherwise have been payable in July, to fully impute previously paid special dividends.""

The HY17 Financial Statements and the remainder of the HY17 Interim Report are unaffected. The attached Mercury HY17 Interim Report replaces the one released to NZX and ASX on the morning of 21 February 2017.

    10:56am, 20 Dec 2016 | DIRECTOR
  

  20 December 2016

MFT: MAINFREIGHT TO APPOINT NEW DIRECTORS

Mainfreight Limited is pleased to advise that Kate Parsons and Sue Tindal will join the Company as Non-Executive Directors from 1 January 2017.

“We have been on the lookout for appropriate individuals to bring onto Mainfreight’s Board for some time”, Mainfreight’s Chairman, Bruce Plested, advised.  “We are delighted that Kate and Sue have accepted these appointments, and we look forward to the energy and skills they will bring to their roles”. 

Kate Parsons has over 20 years’ finance experience in a number of industries both in New Zealand and overseas.  Kate’s passion for high tech, high growth New Zealand success stories, led her to CFO roles at Endace, PowerbyProxi and most recently Compac Sorting Equipment; positions which have given her extensive experience in steering companies through growth and change.

Sue Tindal is currently Group CFO at Auckland Council, and prior to that was a Director, Consulting at PriceWaterhouse Coopers.  Sue returned to New Zealand in 2014 after 15 years overseas and has a wealth of international experience in the financial services, energy and IT sectors, having held numerous senior/chief executive roles at Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

Both Directors will stand for election at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders on 27 July 2017.

    Metlifecare Board Changes

  NZX/ASX Release
12 April 2017

METLIFECARE BOARD CHANGES

Metlifecare Limited advises that the company’s two Infratil director representatives, Kevin Baker and William Smales, have resigned from the Board, effective immediately. Their resignations follow the recent sale of Infratil’s 19.91% stake in the company that has now settled. 

Metlifecare Chair Kim Ellis thanked the two directors for their contribution to the Board since being appointed in 2013. “In the three and a half years Kevin and Will have served on Metlifecare’s Board they have both made a valuable contribution to shareholders. Their diligence and expertise has been much appreciated and, on behalf of the Board, I again thank them for their dedication and first class directorships.”

The company will now commence a director search process, using this opportunity to refresh the Board with the governance skills and capabilities required to guide Metlifecare on its accelerated growth path.

  SHARE CONSOLIDATION OF 1 SHARE PER 20 SHARES CURRENTLY ON ISSUE 

The Company has resolved to implement a share consolidation in order to rationalise the number of ordinary shares of the Company on issue.

The expected timetable for the share consolidation is as follows: 
• 4 January 2017 – Last day for trading in pre-consolidation shares on the NZX Main Board. 
• 5 January 2017 - Ex-date for the consolidation. Mercer's shares are expected to enter a two day trading halt from this date. 
• 6 January 2017 – Record date for the consolidation. 
• 9 January 2017 – Commencement of trading in post-consolidation shares on the NZX Main Board.

    Quarterly Operational Update
    8:30am, 20 Apr 2017 | QUARTER
  

  Three months ended 31 March 2017

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS

- Lowest customer switching rate of major retailers
- LWAP/GWAP improved in conjunction with a 111GWh lift in hydro generation
- Hydro generation forecast up 250GWh for FY17 on higher inflows

LOW CHURN; ENERGY PRICE UP

For the third consecutive quarter, Mercury recorded the lowest switch rate (churn) among the major retailers. For the quarter ended 31 March 2017, Mercury’s annualised churn was 17.6%, well below the market average of 20.5% based on publicly available Electricity Authority data.

Mercury’s loyalty initiatives continued to appeal to customers with a further 13,000 customers registering to receive Airpoints (TM) and customers on fixed-term contracts increasing by 6,000. Customers benefiting from each initiative increased to 110,000 and 149,000 respectively.

The average energy price to customers was up marginally (to $110.70/MWh) when compared to the same period last year ($110.10/MWh). This increase is despite a continued trend of falling prices for commercial and industrial customers (with the VWAP of sales to business customers down approximately $2/MWh).

LIFT IN EXPECTED ANNUAL HYDRO GENERATION

Due to favourable hydrological conditions experienced since February 2017, Mercury has updated its FY2017 mid-point hydro generation forecast to 4,500GWh (up 250GWh on the forecast provided in the preceding operating statistics).

Hydro generation lifted 13% relative to the prior comparable three month period, up 111GWh to 954GWh. This reflects inflows into the Waikato catchment being 170GWh above average and storage being 112GWh higher at 1 January 2017.

LWAP/GWAP was 1.02, an improvement on the same period last year, of 1.03. This benefited from an improvement in hydro GWAP of 2% (to 1.09) despite the management of higher inflows.

Average wholesale prices continued to be impacted by higher than average national hydro generation and averaged $53.49/MWh and $44.37/MWh at Otahuhu and Benmore respectively. This equates to a locational price difference of $9.12/MWh or 21% of the average Benmore price (continuing on from the previous quarter, being $8.38/MWh or 21%).

Geothermal generation was down slightly due to planned plant outages during the period at Ngatamariki and Nga Awa Purua. Geothermal plant availability remains strong, with the quarter again exceeding 95% (relative to 98% for the same quarter last year).

DEMAND SLIGHTLY LOWER

After adjusting for temperature, national demand was down 0.2% compared to the same quarter last year. The reduction in demand was mostly attributable to the industrial sector (-0.5%), which was partially offset by increased demand in the dairy process sector (0.2%).

    FY2017 EBITDAF guidance raised to $510 million
    8:30am, 20 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  FY2017 EBITDAF guidance raised to $510 million

20 April 2017 - Mercury announced today that it has raised its FY2017 EBITDAF guidance by $10 million to $510 million. This is due to a forecast 250 GWh increase in full year hydro generation to 4,500 GWh resulting from unseasonably strong inflows to the Waikato catchment. Other FY2017 guidance remains unchanged.

Guidance may change and remains subject to any material events, significant one-off expenses or other unforeseeable circumstances including changes in hydrological conditions.

1.Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 below, and on the basis that the information provided by Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is complete and accurate in all material respects, NZX Regulation (NZXR) grants MCK a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of its Preference Shares for a period of twelve months from 23 March 2017 to allow MCK to have fewer than 25% of the Preference Shares held by less than 500 Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding.
2.The waiver in paragraph 1 above is provided on the conditions that:
a.the Directors of MCK certify to NZXR, in a form acceptable to NZXR, that allowing the Preference Shares to remain quoted is in the best interests of holders of the Preference Shares; 
b.MCK clearly and prominently discloses the waiver, its conditions, and the implications in its half-year and annual reports; 
c.MCK consistently monitors the total number of Members of the Public holding Preference Shares and the percentage of Preference Shares held by Members of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding and provides NZXR with quarterly updates from the date the waiver is granted during the period of the waiver, such updates to be provided to NZXR within ten business days of the end of each quarter; and 
d.MCK notifies NZXR as soon as practicable if there are any material changes to the total number of Members of the Public holding Preference Shares, and/or the percentage of Preference Shares held by Members of the Public. 
3.The information on which this decision is based is set out in Appendix One to this decision. This waiver will not apply if that information is not or ceases to be full and accurate in all material respects.
4.The Rule to which this decision relates is set out in Appendix Two to this decision.
5.Capitalised terms that are not defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.
Reasons
6.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, NZXR has considered that:
a.the Capital Reduction Scheme undertaken in July 2014 contributed to the decline in spread since the 2014 Waiver was granted. MCK has advised that since the Capital Reduction Scheme was implemented, there has not been a significant decrease in the number of Preference Shareholders;
b.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, MCK would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the Preference Shares. MCK submits that compliance with Rule 5.2.3 is outside of the control of MCK and its Directors;
c.holders of the Preference Shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, the condition in paragraph 2(a) provides NZXR with additional comfort that it is in the best interests of holders of the Preference Shares to allow the Preference Shares to remain quoted on the basis that holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections; 
d.the condition contained in paragraph 2(b) above will provide access to information for both existing holders of the Preference Shares, as well as those wishing to trade in the Preference Shares, of this waiver and its implications for the Preference Shares;
e.the condition contained in paragraph 2(c) above will ensure that NZXR is able to monitor any material changes in MCK’s spread over the period of the waiver; and
f.the waiver is granted for a period of 12 months. This gives NZXR the opportunity to reconsider the spread of the Preference Shares in 12 months’ time if MCK considers a waiver is still required. 
 
Appendix One
1.Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited (MCK) is a Listed Issuer with ordinary Shares and Preference Shares Quoted on the NZX Main Board. 
2.In 2014 MCK undertook a pro rata renounceable offer (Offer) of redeemable Preference Shares (Preference Shares) to all holders of MCK’s ordinary Shares. At the time of the Offer closing, MCK became aware that it would not meet the spread requirements of NZX Main Board Listing Rule (Rule) 5.2.3 in respect of the Preference shares. 
3.On 25 March 2014, being the date of Quotation of the Preference Shares, a total of 206 Members of the Public held 14.8% of the Preference Shares on issue.
4.On 4 April 2014, NZXR granted MCK a waiver from Rule 5.2.3 for the Preference Shares (2014 Waiver) for a period of`12 months from 25 March 2014. 
5.In July 2014, MCK undertook a capital reduction by way of scheme of arrangement (Capital Reduction Scheme). Between the initial announcement of the Capital Reduction Scheme on 4 June 2014, and its implementation on 17 July 2014, the number of holders of Preference Shares decreased from 207 to 184.
6.In 2015 and 2016, two further waivers from Rule 5.2.3 were granted by NZXR to MCK in relation to the Preference Shares. 
7.As at 28 February 2017, 189 Members of the Public hold 8.4% of the Preference Shares on issue, with 11 custodians and nominees holding Preference Shares. 
8.While Aberdeen Asset Management Limited (Aberdeen) holds 6.4% of the Preference Shares, Aberdeen is not considered to be a Member of the Public for the purposes of the Rules on the basis that Aberdeen holds more than 10% of the ordinary Shares in MCK. 
9.MCK has applied for a Waiver from Rule 5.2.3 in respect of the Preference Shares for a further 12 months from 23 March 2017. 
 
Appendix Two
Rule 5.2 Quotation of Securities
5.2.3  A Class of Securities will generally not be considered for Quotation on the NZSX or NZDX unless those Securities are held by at least 500 Members of the Public holding at least 25% of the number of Securities of that Class issued, with each Member of the Public holding at least a Minimum Holding, and those requirements are maintained, or NZX is otherwise satisfied that the Issuer will maintain a spread of Security holders which is sufficient to ensure that there is a sufficiently liquid market in the Class of Securities.

5.Capitalised terms that are not defined in this decision have the meanings given to them in the Rules.
Reasons
6.In coming to the decision to provide the waiver set out in paragraph 1 above, MCK has submitted, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that:
a.the purpose of Rule 5.2.3 is to promote a liquid market which is important to ensure efficient price setting and to enable shareholders to trade;
b.based on the current shareholding, spread and the level of trading over the previous year, NZXR is satisfied that MCK will maintain a spread of security holders which is sufficient to ensure a liquid market;
c.in the absence of a waiver from Rule 5.2.3, MCK would be unable to comply with Rule 5.2.3 and could not continue to quote the ordinary shares; 
d.holders of the Ordinary Shares will not be disadvantaged by the granting of the waiver. Further, MCK submits, and NZXR has no reason not to accept, that it is in the best interests of holders of the ordinary shares to allow the ordinary shares to remain Quoted on the basis that the holders will remain entitled to the protections afforded by the Rules, and a constitution that reflects those protections;

As at 14 January 2017 Aberdeen holds 10.7% of the Ordinary Shares on Issue.

    Strategic land acquisition for future town centre
    8:57am,  7 Apr 2017 | ASSET
  

  Kiwi Property is pleased to advise that it has acquired land, and has secured agreements to acquire further land, in Drury, South Auckland, as a strategic long-term holding to capitalise on Auckland’s continuing population growth.

The three ‘greenfield’ sites, together comprising approximately 51.3 hectares of land, are located in Drury adjacent to the junction of the Southern Motorway, Great South Road and the North Island main trunk railway line, approximately 35 kilometres south of Auckland’s CBD.
  
Chris Gudgeon, Chief Executive, said: “This landholding reinforces our commitment to be part of Auckland’s future growth.”

“Our vision is to develop a town centre, to complement the existing Drury town centre, which would be staged over the next 20 years to coincide with predicted population growth, household formation and employment growth in South Auckland,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“We will work with Auckland Council and infrastructure providers to secure a town centre zoning providing for commercial and retail uses integrated with high, medium and low density housing – all within walking distance of an integrated public transport node.”

The acquisition price for two of the land parcels, totalling 42.7 hectares [NOTE 1], is $39.8 million.  The third land parcel of 8.6 hectares, has been secured via a right of first refusal, with the purchase price to be determined with reference to the market when the right is exercised.

NOTE 1: Overseas Investment Office approval is required in relation to the acquisition of 30.6 hectares.
  
“This is an exciting opportunity for Kiwi Property.  Intensification at key transport nodes and master-planned town centre developments are going to be a big part of our future under the Auckland Unitary Plan,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Drury is already a highly accessible location, at the junction of the Southern Motorway, Great South Road and the North Island main trunk railway line.”

“Transport links to this area are only going to get better with Auckland Transport’s plans for the construction of the Mill Road southern arterial route, electrification of rail through to Pukekohe and the opportunity to construct a railway station adjacent to the town centre.”

The land’s current zoning is ‘Future Urban’ under the Auckland Unitary Plan.

Kiwi Property’s plans for the amalgamated sites will be complementary to an adjacent development being planned by Stevenson Group.
 
“At over 300 hectares in size, the Drury South enterprise district is intended to provide world-class facilities for logistics, manufacturing and commercial operations, together with community facilities and housing,” said Mr Gudgeon.

    KMD March 2017 Half Year Results Release Transcript
    1:05pm, 22 Mar 2017 | ADDRESS
  

  Company:  Kathmandu Ltd
Conference Title:  Kathmandu Half-Year Result Analyst Call
Date:  Tuesday 21 March 2017

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Kathmandu Half Year Result Analyst Call.  Today’s call is being recorded.  At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Xavier Simonet.  Please go ahead, sir.  

Xavier Simonet: Good morning.  Thank you very much and welcome to the First Half FY17 result presentation for Kathmandu Holdings.  My name is Xavier Simonet and I am the CEO of the company.  I’m joined on the call by Reuben Casey, our CFO.  We’ll be talking to the presentation, which you can find on the NZX and ASX this morning.  Most of the numbers are in our reporting currency, the New Zealand Dollar, unless when it is specifically mentioned that they are in Australian Dollars or British Pounds.  

Now, let us move to slide three, strategy recap.  Before we read you the first half numbers, I want to spend a moment on our growth initiatives.  We defined key growth strategies last year.  The strategies have not changed and they remain a constant focus for us.  The first strategy is on products.  We are a design-led business and our core strategy is to design great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products.  

Customer-centricity is the key aspect of our strategic approach.  Last year when we reviewed our promotional model and pricing architecture, it was all about understanding the customer journey and making sure that we get customers excited about our commercial activities.  Customer-centricity is also an essential element of our work on products.  We bring market products that offer solutions to our customers who go to the outdoors and on adventure travel.  

Our products answer the functional needs of our customers, but we also want them to be beautiful and stylish.  I have talked about products. We then have two buckets of key strategies: continuous improvement initiatives, and growth initiatives.  Continuous improvement strategies are about doing better, what we do every day, and optimising our existing assets, strengthening our brand equity, optimising sales and profit densities per square metre in our stores, engaging with our customers partly online and through social media and digital marketing and last, driving cost efficiencies with a relentless focus on cost control. 

New growth initiatives are about capturing international opportunities, and marketplaces, and about continuing to open stores in Australasia, when the right opportunities come up.  I will come back to our strategies and give you an update later in the presentation but I wanted to set the scene.  

If you now go to slides five and six, Result Overview.  In a few words, I would like to highlight our key results of the first half of FY17.  Now, sales and gross margin.  What I consider the main achievement of the first half of FY17, is that we grew same store sales in both core markets, Australia and New Zealand.  Overall, same store sales went up 3.4% on last year at constant exchange rates.  More specifically, we managed to deliver strong same store sales growth in Australia, our biggest market by 5%.  Over the last few years, we have invested significant amounts of money in Australia and opened many stores.  Now is the time to leverage our investments, drive market penetration and generate growth.  

Our gross margin was 61.6% in the first six months of FY17.  Our business was significantly impacted by a stronger US dollar.  Moving to costs and efficiencies, we kept a strong focus on keeping costs tight and on delivering efficiencies.  We also believe that our company should be lean and agile.  As an example, we restructured our retail operations at the end of last year to cut the number of layers and we put in place a leaner and more streamlined organisation.  The objective was also to become a more agile business with a short decision-making process between the stores and the head office.  

Coming back to costs, during the first six months of FY17, operating expenses decreased by 100 basis points as a percentage of sales, or $1.8 million and we improved our operating leverage.  Profit-wise, net profit after tax was up 6.4% at $10 million.  

Slide eight, Sales.  Total company sales were flat on last year at actual exchange rates but up 3% at constant exchange rates.  It is worth noting that UK sales were heavily down on last year due to the closure of bricks and mortar stores, as per the strategic decision we made last year.  Online sales continued to enjoy a healthy level of growth at +18% and account for 7.4% of total company sales.  

Reuben Casey: And just to clarify on slide nine, the Australasian sales growth rate is +4.2% on a constant currency basis, so just taking out the effect on the year on year change in the Australian and New Zealand dollar exchange rate.  

Xavier Simonet:  Slide 10, same store sales result.  Same store sales growth is a key performance indicator for us and one of our key strategic pillars.  I’m pleased to report that both our core markets, Australia and New Zealand delivered same store sales growth in the first half of FY17.  Total company same store sales were up 3.4%.  Same store sales growth was particularly strong in Australia at +5%.  It is interesting to note that growth accelerated and that we gained momentum in the second quarter of FY17.  

On 18 November 2016 at our AGM, we indicated that total company same store sales growth was 1.4% for the first 15 weeks of our financial year.  We saw strong momentum through the key Christmas trading period, particularly after Christmas, and so finished the half with 3.4% growth.  The improvements we have made in the business with a very customer-centric view have contributed to this result.  In particular, all the work that has been done to simplify our promotional calendar, to review pricing architecture, to improve our visual merchandising and to connect and engage with our Summit Club members through digital marketing and much improved content.  I also want to highlight the great job done by our product and design team in New Zealand and by our retail store teams.  

Reuben Casey:  Moving on slide 11, gross margin, which is obviously a key driver of our bottom line profitability.  We did expect to be below last year’s first half-year in this half by around about one percentage point as we had favourable hedging rates rolling off.  We did a lot of work with supplier negotiations, new product introductions which we can introduce at the margin we’d like to introduce, pricing changes and had improved stock management to offset any currency impact, which we largely did.  

However, we still had a decline versus last year and probably can attribute half a percentage point due to FX impact, half a percentage point due to having more clearance this year than last year and the remainder due to timing of sales.  We had a good Christmas period but the sales did come slightly later than we planned, which had a slight degradation on our margin achieved.  

Moving on to slide 12 Cost of Doing Business.  As Xavier said at the beginning, this is an ongoing focus for us and we remain very vigilant on costs.  We have managed to achieve operating leverage versus last year and that’s even allowing for the approximately $1 million one-off cost that we incurred in last year’s result.  The main challenge in our cost base is rent, particularly in Australia where rent continues to increase.  In New Zealand, we haven’t seen the same level of increase that we see in Australia.  

We have made good progress in this half in targeting effective market spend, optimising our use of retail labour, which is a benefit of investments we made in rostering systems, and also maintain head office cost control after our restructure last year.  

Let us move on to the earnings summary on slide 13.  The main thing to point out is when we look at constant exchange rates EBITDA and EBIT, it’s $22 million for EBITDA and $15.2 million for EBIT. That’s at a constant New Zealand / Australian reporting exchange rate.  

Okay, if you look at the country results, starting with Australia on slide 15.  We operated two additional stores during this half, both in Queensland, Gold Coast Harbour Town and North Lakes.  In addition, we completed relocations in some major redevelopments of shopping centres at Pacific Fair, Warringah and Doncaster, and expanded our space in Essendon DFO.  As you can see, the cost of operating in Australia continues to produce a lower EBIT margin than New Zealand.  

And if you look at New Zealand on slide 16, we saw a return to historical gross margin levels after positioning ourselves last year with pricing to offset the US dollar impact that we knew was coming.  We had good operating leverage which helped to offset the margin decline and we continued to invest in refurbishments in Queenstown and Sylvia Park.  

The UK on slide 17, we are cycling store closures as Xavier mentioned earlier, so that’s the main reason why sales have dropped and we are striving to achieve a breakeven position, which we have done.  

Looking at cash flow on slide 19, we made some large CAPEX investments in FY16 on our Australia distribution centre, which is based in Melbourne and flagship stores in Melbourne CBD and Adelaide Rundle Mall.  So although the CAPEX we spent this half is a big reduction on last year, it is simply not a reduction in activity, it’s just that we had some major investments last year.  Operating cash flow remains healthy and we will continue to invest in future growth where a return on investment warrants it.  

If you look at the Balance Sheet now on page 20, we continue to achieve a reduction in inventory year on year.  On a per store basis at the half-year point, we are actually below our FY13 levels and this is a decrease from last year of 3.8% on a constant currency basis.  This is really helping us to have a low level of net debt, which of course means a low level of borrowing costs.  Stock turns, we have to acknowledge are still below what we would like them to be, but we expect them to improve for the year-end position.  

Moving on to Dividends on slide 21, we have declared an interim dividend of NZ 4 cents per share which is an increase on last year’s NZ 3 cents per share.  It’s fully imputed, but not franked and is payable on 16 June 2017.  I’ll hand back to Xavier now for our strategy update.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you Reuben.  Moving on to slides 22, 23, 24, and 25. Strategy Update.  Our five focuses remain the same as last year.  Customer-centricity, creating distinctiveness, delivering great value to our customers, inspiring through our brand, cost control and efficiencies.  As I said earlier, designing great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products and solutions remains our first and core strategy.  Our focus is very clear. It is to answer the needs of our customers related to adventure travel.  

We are very proud.  We got earlier this year, the ISPO Gold award for our Terrane Adapt Pack.  ISPO is the main sports and outdoor show in Europe where we exhibited for the first time this year.  The Terrane Adapt Pack is a technical breakthrough, and it is patented.  Now, last year we defined two sets of growth strategies: continuous improvement strategies and new growth initiatives.  Continuous improvement strategies will deliver sales and profit growth in the next couple of years at the same time as we start executing new growth initiatives, which will take more time to get traction and scale.  

Let me give you a few examples of what we have done in regards to continuous improvement initiatives.  As for brand and customer, I believe that more than just a retailer, Kathmandu is a great brand.  We said last year that we wanted to improve our communication and engagement with our customers, particularly by bringing to life through digital and social media channels distinctive and inspirational stories about our heritage, roots, values, our products and our expertise in adventure travel.  In the first half of FY17, we increased our social media reach by 26%, six million people viewed our videos and we had an increase of 366% in click throughs to our website.  

In regards to Summit Club, we continued growing the number of loyal customers from 1.5 million last year to 1.7 million active customers this year.  In February, we’ve sponsored for the first time the iconic Coast to Coast race in New Zealand, which has become the Kathmandu Coast to Coast.  We generated huge content and engagement from this event with customers and our teams.  As a customer-centric organisation, we have put in place in all our stores, the tools that enable us to measure our net promoter score.  The net promoter score was about 74% in New Zealand and Australia in the first half of FY17, a really good performance.  

Now, moving on to store optimisation.  We have conducted trials in a few stores, which were successful and are now implementing the lessons learned, particularly with regards to range and space and location with a strong emphasis on metrics like sales and gross profit densities by square metre.  In terms of pricing architecture and commercial model, well, the high-low model has been successful for Kathmandu in Australasia.  In FY17, we continue the work that we initiated in FY16, defining a more efficient and clear promotional calendar, adjusting our price points, updating our promotional messaging, making our promotional mechanisms more interesting and surprising.  

Connected customer journey, well we’re continuing to invest in online and digital capabilities as online sales continue to grow at a faster pace than brick and mortar sales.  Online sales accounted for 7.7% of total sales in Australia in the first half of FY17 and 6% in New Zealand.  Our ambition remains for online to generate 10% of total company sales.  

As an example of a significant investment we made, we launched at the end of 2016, a responsive website which integrates content and commerce and gives customers access to inspirational content as they browse on our website and shop.  We also deployed marketing cloud tools in the first half of FY17, which provide targeted email capability and give us the opportunity to leverage our Summit Club database and the work we have done on customer segmentation.  

In regards to cost efficiency, optimising our investments, controlling our cost base, simplifying the way we do business, and evaluating the return on investment are key to our approach.  Let me give you a few examples.  In FY16, we invested in footfall counters for all our stores.  Footfall counters are giving us the ability to track traffic and customer conversion and provide us with very much needed data to make critical promotional decisions, marketing investments and adjust trading activities.  

We have also just opened a new Australian distribution centre in Melbourne with automated sortation capabilities.  We expect efficiency benefits to be realised from FY18.  Last, we have continued to strengthen our supplier partnerships to enhance quality, innovation, sustainability and profitability to help offset exchange rates.  

Moving on to new growth initiatives, and I would like here to particularly talk about international.  For the first time we exhibited this year at ISPO the outdoor and sports trade show in Germany and travelled to Europe to engage with a certain number of European outdoor retailers.  The story of our brand, the distinctiveness of our products and our success story in Australasia were well received.  Some feedback we got from prospective customers is that our products offer good balance between functionality and style.  The first stage in this process was to establish relationships with selected key European retail partners.  I’m pleased to say that we are currently finalising agreements with a couple of strategic retailers in the UK and Germany to run trials in their stores for European winter 2017.  Back to Reuben.  

Reuben Casey: Thanks Xavier.  I’m just going to say a few words about sustainability on slide 26.  Something we don’t really talk about enough is our commitment to sustainability and it’s something that’s inherently part of our company values, is very important to our customers and to our employees.  Last November, we were honoured to receive a Large Business Sustainability Leaders award in Australia, awarded by the Banksia Foundation.  And we’ve set ourselves some challenging goals to achieve around re-using plastic bottles in our products, zero waste to landfill, 100% use of sustainable cotton, and reductions in carbon emissions.  

These are all challenges that involve a truly cross-functional effort by everyone in the company.  We also remain committed to progressing to full Fair Labour Association accreditation, a Bluesign membership, minimising our carbon footprint, engaging with the community and investing in our team’s training and development.  For Kathmandu, we see this as not just window dressing or a box ticking exercise but it embodies who we are and how we operate and what we believe is the right thing to do.  If you have not had the chance, I would encourage you all to read our 2016 Sustainability Report available on our investor website for more insight. 

Xavier Simonet: Last slide of the presentation, slide 28, Outlook.  In the industry, the outdoor industry is and will remain immensely competitive.  At Kathmandu, we believe with passion that, more than just a retailer, Kathmandu is a great brand.  Our own in-house product design team based in Christchurch, designs great, innovative, distinctive and sustainable quality products.  We are up for the challenge to compete, not only in Australia and New Zealand, but also internationally.  

The international wholesale opportunities are developing and we’re really starting a journey that’s going to take some time but the recent trip to Europe have given us confidence that both our brand and products have strong relevance, offer distinctiveness, and can have credibility internationally.  We also remain committed to continuous improvements, and in the second half of FY17, we refocus on same store sales growth, particularly in Australia; strengthening the Kathmandu brand and customer engagement; connecting with customers through social media and digital channels; cost control, and efficiencies.  

That is all from me.  Thank you very much for joining the conference call this morning and we’re going to take a few questions.  

Operator: Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 on your telephone keypad.  If you’re on a speaker phone, please make sure you turn off your mute function so your signal can reach our equipment.  Once again, for questions at this time, please press *1 now.  And we do have a question from Chelsea Leadbetter from Forsyth Barr.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Thanks Moderator and morning, guys.  If I can just start with - are you there?  Can you hear me? 

Xavier Simonet:  Yes, good morning.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay, morning guys.  Just start with outlook and I appreciate it’s far too early ahead of winter to give any particular guidance but you did comment on improved momentum in the second quarter.  Have you seen that continue since balance date? 

Reuben Casey: We’re not going to comment on trading since balance date, simply because the time of our autumn promotion is different to last year so it’s really difficult to give an accurate picture of that.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  Well, then I guess I’ll ask another sort of question along the same lines.  The backdrop that you’re seeing in the competitive landscape in both Aussie and New Zealand, have you seen any meaningful changes over the last six months or going forward with respect to your competitors? 

Reuben Casey: I might comment that our outlook is constantly changing and that’s really what we’re seeing.  In Australia, we’ve seen adventure mega store open a few stores, that have the Colombia license, and Macpac have opened a few stores. There’s not been a whole lot of change in New Zealand and Mountain Design are opening a few stores in regional centres.  Rays have gone through kind of contraction and reformatting, so it’s constantly changing.  

Xavier Simonet: And all the brands and retailers are making efforts for continuous improvements – to make continuous improvements as well.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay, thank you.  And just, you’ve touched quite a bit on the Australian rent profile and what you’ve seen in that market in particular.  Does that change your thinking on the store footprint?  I appreciate you haven’t changed your target but on the store footprint size or any other sort of ways to offset that rent pressure that you’re kind of seeing in that Australian market in particular? 

Xavier Simonet: I think it’s about finding a balance between these national stores where we can display all our products, particularly our camping and our tents.  And shopping centres is where the traffic is.  So it’s really about finding the balance.  It’s difficult and we challenge ourselves all the time but we certainly see shopping centres as driving traffic.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  So we shouldn’t expect any material change on how you’re approaching the store footprint at this point in time?  

Reuben Casey: Not at this point, no.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: And just last question, you’ve talked a bit about some of the ranging trials that you’ve been doing through the last six to 12 months, can you give us any sort of hard financial examples of what you’ve actually seen as a result i.e. EBIT uplift per store or per square metre or anything like that? 

Xavier Simonet: Well, we don’t want to share too much.  We’ve really worked on improving sales and gross profit densities per square metre.  It’s about assortment and range to space allocation. 

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  So you can’t give us any hard sort of ideas of is it double digit or is it more material than sort of that? 

Xavier Simonet:  It’s material.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  

Reuben Casey: Yeah, we can’t do that, I’m sorry.  

Chelsea Leadbetter: Okay.  That’s all for me for now.  Thank you.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thanks.  

Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1.  Our next question will come from John Stavliotis with Morgan Stanley.  

Xavier Simonet:  Morning, John.  

John Stavliotis: Morning.  Just a question on - you talk a bit about this European opportunity obviously being in discussions.  What does the partnership look like in terms of the contract and how it would be structured? 

Xavier Simonet: Yeah, I can’t comment yet.  We’re in the process of finalising agreements and it is just too early.  We went to Europe in November, went back to Europe for ISPO in February and we’ve been engaging with potential partners since then and finalising those agreements.  So it’s just a bit too early to confirm.  Sorry, John.  

John Stavliotis: It’s all right.  

Xavier Simonet: It’s also [inaudible].   

John Stavliotis: Sorry? 

Xavier Simonet: It is wholesale [inaudible].  

John Stavliotis: And negotiations you’re having now, are they about that kind of initial trials and stuff or is that actually about forming a kind of a full range for them?  Or is it too early to talk about that as well?  

Xavier Simonet:  Yeah, I can’t comment because we’re in the middle of discussions with those partners.

John Stavliotis: Yes, so.  Just on a different note, cost out opportunities, clearly have some good cost leverage in this half, is there any other sort of initiatives that you can sort of see cost reductions in the next six to twelve months?   

Reuben Casey: We don’t see significant opportunities for any cost outs, going forward.  

John Stavliotis: Okay.  And last question from me.  You mentioned something about more promotional or more promotional days or more discounting during the half, can you just give a bit more detail on that?  What drove that and what we should expect going forward? 

Reuben Casey: Yeah, I don’t recall actually saying that, John.  

John Stavliotis: On gross margin – you split out movement on the gross margin between currency and discounting.  

Reuben Casey: Yeah, half a percentage point is really the FX kind of headwind that we couldn’t cover.  Half a percentage point was down to more clearance than we had generally last year. We ended the year with slightly more clearance than was probably optimal and then that meant we had a slightly higher mix of clearance sales, particularly in the first quarter.  And then there’s 0.2% which is really due to timing of sales so Christmas was a bit of slow starter but then once it came, it came quite late but it’s just had a small impact on our margin as well.  

John Stavliotis: Okay.  

Reuben Casey: The promotional days, the promotional days for the half is identical to last year in terms of the number of days we were on promotion, just the timing is different, that’s all.  

John Stavliotis: Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you.  

Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you’d like to ask a question at this time, please press *1 now.  And once again that is a final reminder for questions at this time, press *1.  And I show we have no further questions at this time.  

Reuben Casey: Thank you.  

Operator: We’ll turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.  

Xavier Simonet:  Thank you very much for joining the conference call.  Have a good morning.  

Operator: That does conclude our conference at this time.  Thank you for your participation.  You may now disconnect.

    ikeGPS Announces Co-Marketing and Integration With SAi 
    8:30am,  3 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  For Immediate Release          April 3, 2017 

ikeGPS Announces Co-Marketing and Integration With SAi 
Ð Spike integrated into design software used by more than 100,000 sign customers –

BROOMFIELD, Colo.—ikeGPS announces a new co-marketing and software integration deal with SA International and its Flexi software, the sign design software used by more the 100,000 end users. This integration allows Spike to offer a more full solution to customers with respect to sign design and further its presence in the sign and digital graphics industry. 

With customers in over 50 countries, SAi is a leader in offering software solutions from design to production for the sign making, digital printing, screen printing and CNC machining industries. SAi also boasts a large network of resellers, and Flexi offered in more than 13 languages. 

“We are excited to partner with such a respected player in the sign and digital graphics industry as we work toward making Spike a fuller solution that specifically addresses the needs of the sign market,” says Glenn Milnes, CEO of ikeGPS. “Our integration with SAi’s Flexi is a positive step in expanding Spike’s reach within the market.” 

The new integration allows Flexi users to export a scaled image from the Spike Cloud and import it directly into Flexi design software. The 1-to-1 scaled image removes several steps from the design process, enabling sign shops to much more quickly turnaround work estimates with design renderings. 

Spike allows sign and digital graphics professionals to quickly and safely capture measurements for estimates of signage locations from a smartphone or tablet picture and the Spike device. A ladder, bucket truck and tape measure are no longer required to conduct site surveys and create estimates and designs, saving sign companies time and overhead costs on a traditionally lengthy process.

The measurements of the sign or graphic location are saved with the Spike photo and can be shared with customers, designers or production team to create job estimates and design proofs, assess installation and complete permit applications. If additional measurements are needed, users can refer to their saved Spike photos at any time to make modifications using the Spike mobile app or Spike Cloud. There’s no need to return to the site for further measurements or estimates. 

ikeGPS and SAi will announce the new integration to the sign and digital grpahics industry at the International Sign Association Sign Expo in Las Vegas April 20-22, where Spike was last year given the 2016 Innovation Award for the industry. For more information on how Spike is changing the way measurements and assets are captured and managed, visit www.ikegps.com/spike/.

    IKE Update
    9:01am,  5 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  For Immediate Release       5 April 2017

 IKE Update 

IKE advises the following:
- Stanley Smart Measure Pro units shipped into the European construction market ended at 30,500 units for the year, above original guidance but below the latest projected volumes of 39,500 units.  The additional 9,000 units, ordered for March 2017 delivery, will now ship 1H FY18.
- Stanley Black &amp; Decker made the decision to defer acceptance of these 9,000 units.  For IKE this had an impact on cash-received in the quarter of greater than $1m.  This was expected to contribute to projected cash positive operation for the quarter, which was not achieved. 
- Positively, IKE4 orders from the electric utility and communications market strengthened again in Q4 FY18. 
IKE CEO, Glenn Milnes, commented, “An unfortunate item to end what was an otherwise positive period for the business was Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s decision to defer their acceptance of 9,000 units that were ordered for March delivery.  We do not believe this impacts the longer-term potential for sales of the Stanley Smart Measure Pro product, which have grown strongly this year, but clearly this was a disappointment for us from a period end and reporting perspective.”  

“More positively, IKE4 sales, the biggest contributor to IKE’s revenue and margin, ended the fourth quarter well.  Our cash position at year end was approximately $2.8m and we are taking positive overall sales momentum into FY18 with the addition of the above orders that will now ship from April.”

    IQE  Intueri 2016 Annual Report and s 209 notice
    8:55am, 24 Mar 2017 | ANNREP
  

  NZX RELEASE

24 March 2017

IQE – INTUERI 2016 ANNUAL REPORT AND S 209 NOTICE

Listed vocational education provider Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) has today released its Annual Report for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016. The Annual Report is available for viewing on the company website www.intueri.co.nz. 

Changes to Preliminary Results Announcement
Due to the change in timing of the closure of the Australian colleges, which has now been brought forward to 29 March 2017, the recoverability and value of assets held in Australia has been reassessed since the release of the preliminary financial statements. This has resulted in further costs of $0.95m associated with an impairment charge of $0.15m, a $0.7m reduction in current assets no longer considered recoverable, and an additional $0.1m in liabilities associated with closure costs. The net loss after tax has increased to $24.3m from $23.3m.

Going Concern Basis
After careful consideration, Intueri’s Directors formed the judgement that it was appropriate to prepare the 2016 financial statements on a going concern basis. 

The Directors acknowledge however that alternative interpretations are possible, that Intueri’s financial position and prospects remain subject to change, and that material uncertainties remain which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, relating primarily to the outcome of the capital restructure, the Group’s ability to pay debts, ongoing bank support, the achievement of enrolment numbers and cost savings, and the resolution of the outstanding Tertiary Education Commission investigation into Quantum Education group. 

Further information is outlined in Note 2 of the financial statements included in the 2016 Annual Report. 

Audit Opinion
The independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has not been able to form an opinion on these Financial Statements due to the significant uncertainties and insufficient audit evidence to satisfy, within their materiality limits, the carrying value of non-current assets in the Statement of Financial Position, and whether the application of the going concern assumption is appropriate.

There is no certainty that a bid will materialise or an acquisition be completed as a result of the current strategic review, and Intueri recommends that persons considering trading in Intueri shares seek professional advice prior to doing so.

    IQE- Grant Thornton Appointed to Wind Up Australian Subs
    8:30am,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX RELEASE

6 April 2017

IQE – GRANT THORNTON APPOINTED TO WIND UP AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARIES

Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) today announces that Grant Thornton partners Andrew Hewitt and Shaun McKinnon have been appointed as liquidators to all of Intueri’s Australian subsidiaries, following the cessation of operations in Australia in March 2017. 

The decision by Intueri’s Board to close the Australian operations was in response to a number of recent developments, which have already been announced. The lack of VET FEE-HELP (VFH) funding from the Department of Education and Training, along with regulatory changes in Australia, have been determining factors. Intueri’s Australian subsidiaries have not received any VFH payments in 2017 for students taught up to the cessation of operations, and due to the Group’s current position, Intueri is unable to continue to provide financial support to maintain its Australian subsidiaries.

Intueri continues to focus on its New Zealand businesses and the current strategic review, and the liquidation is not expected to have any impact on the New Zealand operations of the Intueri Group.

Chair of Intueri, Chris Kelly, commented; “The Board has been investigating a number of potential options for the Australian business, including the possible sale of assets and brand names. Disappointingly none of these other avenues have been able to be realised.”

Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) today announces that Nico Marx has notified the Intueri Board of his intention to resign as director, at a date yet to be confirmed, but expected to be before 28 April 2017, following his acceptance of a new role based in Singapore.

Chair of Intueri, Chris Kelly, commented; “The Board acknowledges Nico’s contribution to the Intueri Board and its committees. The Board is focussed on maintaining governance experience appropriate to Intueri’s current needs and will announce the new Board appointment shortly.”

    IQE SFO Enquiry into Quantum Closed
    10:08am, 12 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  IQE – SFO ENQUIRY INTO QUANTUM CLOSED 

Intueri Education Group Limited (NZX: IQE) has been advised that the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has decided to close their enquiry into Quantum Education Group, with no further action required.

This enquiry, which focused on historical enrolment matters at Quantum, followed an initial request for information in January 2016. Intueri received no further requests or notifications from the SFO following the request for information.

The only outstanding regulatory matter for Intueri is the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) investigation into Quantum. Intueri is scheduled to provide a response to the draft investigation report by 12 May 2017.

Chris Kelly, Intueri Chair says “Intueri is very pleased that the SFO enquiry has been closed. We are focused on providing a response to the draft TEC report, and look forward to a conclusion of that investigation shortly. We are continuing to focus on delivery of quality vocational learning opportunities for both domestic and international students in New Zealand through our three PTE groups.”

    NPT Shareholder Update - Shareholder Meeting
    10:30am, 12 Apr 2017 | S/HOLDER
  

  12 April 2017

Dear Shareholder,

By now you should have received your copy of the Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held in Auckland on 21st April 2017.

There has been a lot of commentary in the media lately; therefore I am writing this letter so that you have a first-hand view of what your Board is recommending and why.

The resolutions being put forward at the special meeting are critical to the future of NPT Limited and your investment in the Company.

In essence, the resolutions will decide firstly, and very importantly, if you want your Company governed by the current Board of Carol Campbell, Jim Sherwin and myself, or governed by new directors who have been put forward by Augusta Capital including the Chair of Augusta Capital, Paul Duffy.

Your current Board has addressed the issues facing NPT, being its low share price relative to the net tangible value of its assets (NTA) and its sub optimal size, $170 million of assets.

The Board proposed by Augusta has not put forward its strategy for the Company. If the resolutions proposed by Augusta are passed, the directors nominated by Augusta would have the authority to take NPT in any direction they choose, including the ability to grant Augusta a contract to manage the Company and its assets if they wished.

It is this uncertainty around the intentions of an Augusta promoted Board that leads me to ask you to consider this carefully as our Board considers that voting for the three Augusta nominees is not in the best interests of shareholders. This will require a vote NO to Resolutions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The second major issue is the future of NPT and your investment in it. Clearly, NPT is too small to continue as a sustainable operation. Your Board has addressed this by seeking proposals from parties that will grow the Company; provide first class management; and drive for a sustainable future for your Company.

The Board has received a high quality proposal from Kiwi Property Group that will afford NPT the benefits of scale through a single transaction, set the Company on a path of sustainable growth and add significantly to the Company’s depth of management.

 
The nature of the management contract sets a new standard in the New Zealand listed property market. It can be cancelled by NPT without cause after 5 years with shareholder approval, with a market based fee to be paid in that event. The management contract could only be sold by Kiwi to a third party if NPT provides its written consent to that sale. Kiwi brings a team of 170 to assist us in managing your Company.

We want to emphasise - this is not a takeover by Kiwi. Your Board will continue to govern NPT on your behalf and NPT will still own its portfolio of properties including those being purchased from Kiwi.

The Board has had advice from Northington Partners who assessed all proposals submitted to the Board. The Kiwi Proposal was well ahead of all other proposals. It has also received support from independent brokers.

The Kiwi proposal is definite and capable of execution now versus any proposal Augusta may wish to develop and put forward. The Kiwi proposal offers certainty for NPT’s future; Augusta has not put forward any plan.

On this basis, the Board recommends that you vote YES for Resolution 1.

The future of your Company is in your hands. It is clear to everyone that our retail investors will control the outcome of the vote. I ask you to take this matter very seriously and to exercise your vote.

This can be done by following the voting procedure at the special meeting or by appointing a proxy.  If you have already voted and wish to change your vote you can contact Link Market Services by phone on +64 9 375 5998 or by email at enquiries@linkmarketservices.co.nz.

The manager of one of our major institutional investors, ANZ Investments, has written a very informative article about the issues NPT faces, I have attached this article for your information.

Your Board is committed to putting in place the strategy it has developed to grow your wealth as shareholders

Kind regards
 
Tony Sewell
Chairman

    Prospective Operational and Capital Restructure
    5:23pm, 15 Nov 2016 | GENERAL
  

  15 November 2016

BY E-MAIL: announce@nzx.com

NZX Limited
Wellington

PROSPECTIVE OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL RESTRUCTURE 
NZF Group Limited (""NZF"") advises that:
Entry into conditional Implementation Deed
NZF has today entered into a conditional Implementation Deed with Blackwell Global Group Limited (“Blackwell”), which company is associated with Kaw Sing Chai, who earlier in the year subscribed for new shares in NZF pursuant to a private placement. 
The purpose of the Implementation Deed is to regulate the manner in which NZF and Blackwell propose to implement an operational and capital restructure of the Company, subject to the prior approval of the Company’s shareholders.

Objectives of the Capital and Operational Restructure of NZF (“Restructure”)

The principal objectives of the Restructure are to reorganise the capital and organisational structure of NZF as follows:
1. The issue of 313,872,866 new ordinary fully paid shares by NZF to Blackwell and other investors introduced by Blackwell (and/or their respective nominees). The issue price per new share shall be $0.008 per share. The aggregate subscription price will be $2,510,982.93; 
2. The issue of up to 3,000,000 convertible notes (“Notes”) by NZF to Blackwell and/or its nominee(s). The Notes shall have an aggregate face value of $3,000,000. The Notes shall accrue interest and shall be convertible into ordinary shares in NZF, at the option of the Noteholder, at a conversion price of $0.008 per share;
3. The appointment of new Directors to the board of directors of NZF (""Board"") post completion of the Restructure;

4. The introduction of additional human resources into NZF to fulfil the executive roles required to achieve the implementation of the Restructure, in addition to the resource already retained by NZF;

5. The launch of a new finance company operation;

6. The launch of a new derivative trading operation, in conjunction with the purchase of certain derivative trading assets from Blackwell;

7. The obtaining of all requisite FMA and statutory licences and registrations required in connection with the Restructure and by NZF to undertake the Finance Company Operations and the Derivative Trading Operations;

8. The issue of up to $6,000,000 of secured bonds (“Bonds”) to Blackwell and/or third party investors introduced by Blackwell to assist in funding the growth of the Company’s finance company operations, and the acquisition of the Derivative Business Assets by NZF.

Conditions 
Completion of the Restructure is subject to, and conditional upon, (amongst other matters) the satisfaction of the necessary regulatory approvals and sign offs, and the Shareholders of NZF approving all of the resolutions required to be passed to implement the Restructure. 
The Board anticipates that the Special Meeting of Shareholders to consider the Restructure will be held during the course of February 2017, and should the Shareholders approve the Restructure, the Restructure will complete shortly thereafter.

The NZF Board recommends that NZF shareholders should not undertake any action in respect of their shares that they hold until such time as NZF is able to provide those shareholders will a full suite of information pertaining to the Restructure, including the independent reports

    NZME Fairfax NZ Merger Update
    9:28am, 29 Mar 2017 | MERGER
  

  NZME FAIRFAX NZ MERGER UPDATE

SYDNEY and AUCKLAND, 29 March 2017: NZME Limited (NZX:NZM, ASX:NZM) (“NZME”) and Fairfax Media Limited’s (ASX:FXJ) Fairfax New Zealand Limited (“Fairfax”) have received, and agreed to, a request from the New Zealand Commerce Commission (“NZCC”) to further extend the target date for the NZCC’s final decision on the proposed merger of the two businesses to 2 May 2017.  

In the parties view this further extension to 2 May reflects that the NZCC is taking an appropriately thorough approach to reviewing the information provided by the merger parties.   The process and extension is consistent with the NZCC’s typical practices.

NZME and Fairfax remain of the view that the merger enhances the ability of the companies to invest in new revenue streams and continue to deliver high quality, local journalism and content to audiences, and therefore creates a unique opportunity to sustainably deliver an improved and innovative path forward for print/digital publishing and journalism in New Zealand.

    Shareholders Approve Scheme of Arrangement
    11:53am, 12 Apr 2017 | MEETING
  

  A resolution approving a $100m return of capital was passed by a resounding majority at a special meeting of New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas shareholders held at 10am this morning.

The following resolution was voted on by shareholders at the special meeting:
“THAT the Scheme of Arrangement:
a) relating to the return of capital to the holders of Ordinary Shares; and
b) relating to the holders of Part-Paid Shares,
as set out in the Notice of Special Meeting, be approved.”
The required voting thresholds for approval of this resolution were: 
a) 75 per cent or more of the votes cast by holders of Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and voting on the resolution;
b) 75 per cent or more of the votes cast by holders of Part-Paid Shares entitled to vote and voting on the resolution; and
c) a simple majority of the votes of those shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.

The resolution was voted on by way of a poll and the results were:
Please see attached document

In addition, 62.79% of the votes of those shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution were in favour of the resolution.

In summary, each required voting threshold described above was met, and accordingly the resolution was carried.

A further resolution moved by a shareholder, ""That NZOG retain the $168 million plus enough from reserves to drill two wells off shore Oamaru for gas and or oil,"" was defeated on a show of hands.

New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas expects to receive a final ruling from Inland Revenue on the tax status of the capital return within the next week. It will then seek final orders from the High Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement, with the aim of completing the return of capital before the end of May.

Further details of the scheme of arrangement are available at www.nzog.com/capitalreturn.

    Inland Revenue binding ruling on Scheme of Arrangement
    3:41pm, 13 Apr 2017 | S/A
  

  A favourable ruling has been received from Inland Revenue on a scheme of arrangement that, if approved by the court, will return $100 million of capital to ordinary shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas.

The binding ruling means that the return of capital under the scheme will not be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as being in lieu of a dividend.

Under the scheme, half the ordinary shares in New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas will be cancelled and holders will receive approximately 62.7 cents per cancelled share.  Shareholders approved the scheme at a special meeting on 12 April 2017.

The scheme is now only conditional on receipt of a final court order approving the scheme.  The company will be submitting an application for this court order shortly, with a view to implementing the scheme and making payments to shareholders before the end of May.

Advice received by directors is that the ruling confirms that the sums paid to shareholders under the scheme should not be treated as a dividend. Any profit (or loss) realised on the cancellation of shares should be tax free if the shares are held on capital account. This advice is a non-exhaustive guide and shareholders are advised to obtain professional tax advice applicable to their own circumstances.

Further details of the scheme of arrangement are available at www.nzog.com/capitalreturn.

NZX Limited
Wellington

Agreement with Inland Revenue Department and Update on the Capital and Operational Restructure of NZF

GST Issue
The Company has previously advised that: 
- the Inland Revenue Department was reviewing the Company’s GST returns for the period 1 April 2013 onwards in relation to the Company’s ability to claim GST on expenses incurred; and

- it was likely that the Company would have to repay previously claimed GST.

Agreement has now been reached with IRD to repay the IRD an amount of $187,027 in aggregate. The sum is to be paid by twenty-four monthly instalments of $7,793. The first instalment is due and payable on 20 March 2017.

Capital and Operational Restructure
Further to our announcement on 15 November 2016 advising that NZF had entered into a conditional Implementation Deed with Blackwell Global Group Limited (“Blackwell”), the Company advises that:

- the drafting of the Notice of Meeting, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Independent Advisers Report and Appraisal Report are well advanced;

- it is hoped to have the aforementioned documentation forwarded to the NZX and to the Takeovers Panel for their review during the course of the next week;

- it is anticipated that a special meeting of shareholders will be called to approve the capital and operational restructure during the course of April or May.

    Quarterly Activities Report

  ANNOUNCEMENT BY NEW TALISMAN GOLD MINES LIMITED [ASX, NZSX: NTL]

FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

Quarterly Activities Report to 31 December 2016

New Talisman Gold Mines Limited is pleased to present the quarterly report on activities for the period ended 31 December 2016 

HIGHLIGHTS

• Charbel Nader appointed as Chairman
• Talisman Prefeasibility updated
• Talisman Deeps analysis identifies mineralised extensions
• Rahu targeting work commenced

Corporate

As announced in the Half yearly report released in December the company has recently appointed 2 new Directors with Mr Charbel Nader being appointed as Chairman during the period and Mr Murray McKee stepping down as Chairman. 

TALISMAN GOLD PROJECT (100%) – Hauraki District, NZ
During the quarter to December 2016 the company continued to make progress towards initiating works at the Talisman Mine. Having received approval in principle for the company’s proposals for managing traffic safety on the mine road, and having completed the preliminary roadway design, the focus remains on agreeing the final road design parameters with local council. 

The company continues to engage with the council and other stakeholders to achieve a design that reflects the needs of all road users and acknowledges that, while progress is not as rapid as initially hoped, it is necessary to follow a continuous review process in order to ensure the safety of all road users when operations commence. Once complete the company will be able to issue tender documents for the full scope of works including earthworks and traffic control requirements.

Risk assessment of the projects preliminary electrical reticulation system design has been completed and suitable controls to manage those risks have been identified. Those controls have been documented in the hazard management plans and are now being incorporated into the final system design. 

Work on the update of the pre-feasibility study continues with current efforts centred on an update of the resource estimate utilising geochemical and structural information obtained from the historical database. This is being run in parallel with the Talisman Deeps project which is discussed in the next section. 

Talisman Deeps Project

The Talisman Deeps project has progressed well during the quarter. This project was commissioned with the objective of identifying extensions to the existing indicated and inferred mineral resources through analysis and modelling of the historical database acquired by the company in 2015. The first stage of this project will involve merging all existing data into one comprehensive database and compiling the most advanced three dimensional model of the mines geology and historical workings ever produced.
 
Data verification of the historic geochemical sampling database is complete, the most important historical plans have been digitally scanned and digitising of the historic workings and structural geology is now well underway.

Preliminary results previously reported suggest sizeable blocks of unmined ground remain between the 10 and 16 Levels in sections of the Maria Vein referred to as the Talisman and Bonanza Shoots.

The figure below shows the existing resource block in the Dubbo Shoot and gold equivalent grades in grams per tonne from channel samples collected circa 1919 in the old workings in the Talisman and Bonanza Shoots.

Mined out blocks are not shown as their locations and dimensions are still being evaluated from historic mine plans. 
The quality control and assurance procedures in place at the time that the samples were taken cannot be verified at this stage and therefore the data cannot currently be used to generate mineral resource or reserve estimates that will comply with the requirements of the JORC code 2012 but do constitute an Exploration Target as defined in the 2012 JORC Code. The potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. 

Rahu

During the quarter, Newcrest, the manager of exploration activities at the Rahu project has undertaken geological studies utilising data provided to it by NTL to define deep drill targets. These studies included a re-evaluation of Rahu drill core using hyperspectral analysis and chemical analysis to determine zonal patterning of hydrothermal alteration mineralogy and geochemistry indicative of gold mineralisation at depth.

Amer

During the period NTL met with representatives of Amer and while the groups have continued to express an interest  in working together; however agreement on material matters such as valuation, and asset composition, are not at this stage in a form capable of being considered by the Company and its Shareholders. Both parties have agreed to continue to investigate the opportunity.

Tenements 

The interest in Mining Tenements Held by New Talisman Gold Mines (and its subsiduaries) at the end of the quarter and related percentage of ownership.

ANNEXURE 1

It is noted that the spend on Development was $111,914 for the quarter compared to $200,000 budgeted for. The reason for the variance is due to preliminary work expected to be performed on the Talisman Mining Project being moved to the following quarter.

It is also noted that the spend on Administration was $169,987 for the quarter compared to $200,000 budgeted for. The reason for the variance is due to lower administrative expenses than anticipated.

    Quarterly Activities Report
    2:59pm, 21 Apr 2017 | QUARTER
  

   _______________________________________________________
 
21ST APRIL 2017

ANNOUNCEMENT BY NEW TALISMAN GOLD MINES LIMITED [ASX, NZSX: NTL]
FOR PUBLIC RELEASE
Quarterly Activities Report to 31 March 2017

New Talisman Gold Mines Limited is pleased to present the quarterly report on activities for the period ended 31 March 2017 

Key Highlights
• Operations at Talisman site to commence immediately
• Talisman Deeps data provides evidence of potential to increase gold resources below 15 Level
• Talisman Deeps provides significant opportunity to expand bulk sampling footprint beyond current resource
• Certificate of Compliance issued which allows establishment of site activities at Talisman Mine site
• Road movements allowed for in the certificate granted
• Newcrest completes first quarter activities at Rahu
• K S Black appointed as auditor
• Coromandel Gold in discussions on Vanuatu projects

During the period under review the company has been busy establishing further components to the Talisman Deeps project development which is proving significant for the long term future of the Talisman Mine. The team has also been focussed on gaining access to the site and the Board is delighted to announce it has today been granted a certificate of compliance which will allow commencement of activities at the site immediately. 
As announced in the previous quarterly report the company and council are working together on finalising a traffic management plan (TMP) that meets the needs of council and NTL. Whilst Company mine traffic on the road will be minimal,  with reference to safety guidelines we have sought specialist input from our engineers and the council engineers 
As detailed further below the company has been working on the Talisman deeps project which has resulted in identification of a number of additional areas of mineralisation which can potentially be included in the bulk sampling project. Accessing these areas will require opening up and making safe a number of the historical drives, particularly those connecting 8 Level with 7 Level above and 10 Level below. 
In order to commence these works the company lodged with the Hauraki District Council in December an application for a certificate of compliance to undertake permitted activities under the district plan in order to evaluate the Talisman deeps and Talisman mine projects. The activities, which have been outlined as separate from activities to be undertaken under the resource consent held for bulk sampling, allows the company to begin site works immediately. 
To ensure that we are compliant with the requirements of the district plan the company engaged independent planning experts to assist in compiling the scope of work. The scope was examined by planners employed by the District Council and verified by a third party independent consultancy. Whilst this has taken some time, we are pleased to report that it has progressed and has proved ultimately successful. 
 The Certificate of Compliance has been granted which will allow the company to immediately commence activities on site and begin sampling work at the mine to test Talisman and Talisman Deeps geological data. Many of the activities are core to safe operations at the site and therefore will not have to be duplicated upon commencement of bulk sampling under the resource consent. 
The works being undertaken at site include: -
 Perimeter fencing – erection of safety and security fencing around the portal site;
 Construction of the portal pad and associated structures;
 Ventilation fan – installation of a new ventilation fan at the entrance to the mine;
 Installation of a Generator and Air compressor;
 Installation of reticulation services through the underground workings;
 Removal of old beams and replacement of underground structures;
 Sampling and Drilling at Mystery and other targeted areas.;
 Establishment of site office and security office;
 Road use and maintenance – to enable safe and efficient transport of prospecting vehicles; and
 Vegetation management – trimming and weed control as necessary within the site and within the existing footprint of the mine road.

The Construction of the above will commence immediately and will be carried out in parallel with the works required to fully implement the requirements of the Traffic Management Plan.
Chairman Charbel Nader said “It is a pleasure to say we are commencing works at the Talisman site area.  With access now available to establish the site we are well on our way to progressing our ambitions for the historically productive Talisman Mine. 
We intend to undertake sampling operations to establish the deeper orebody immediately whilst finalising the Traffic management plan. We are very excited by the prospect of Talisman Deeps and believe it will likely enhance the bulk sampling project and ultimately the long term future of the mine .”

Design work on the project has progressed well and is approaching completion. 
Electrical Design
All drawings are drafted and have gone through final checks and verifications, Equipment lists are in place and suitable suppliers for the various components have been identified. 
Vent Lock
Final reviews of the mechanical and structural drawings are complete and we are preparing the tender documentation for construction of the lock.
 
The Talisman Deeps Project -Talisman Deeps Project identifies High Grade areas &gt;1 oz per ton
As announced on 16 August 2016 the company is undertaking an exercise to further quantify mineral resources hosted within the Maria Vein system known as the Talisman Deeps project. This exercise was prompted by the acquisition of a large database of historical mine maps and geochemical data which has greatly added to the company’s knowledge of the historic mine workings and ore grades mined during the mine’s operational history. 
Progress on the Talisman Deeps analysis project has now reached an advanced stage with database compilation and verification complete. Historic mine workings have been digitally captured and modelled into a three dimensional wireframe and structural modelling of the Maria Vein is complete within the Dubbo and Bonanza Sections. 
Modelling and analysis completed to date supports NTL’s belief that the gold mineralised vein material may extend below the existing mine workings. Analysis of 926 samples taken from raise sampling in the lower workings of the Talisman and Bonanza Zones, highly productive areas of the historical mine and source of the majority of the 3.5 million bullion ounces produced, indicate a mean grade of 36.75g/t gold equivalent in a range of trace to 219.55g/t. There is evidence on the mine plans that no stoping took place below No 15 level but that high grade ore persists in this area. NTL currently have no quantified mineral resources in this area. Four raises below 15 level, covering a strike length of some 500m and a dip extent of 49m have geo-referenced historic sample values. Some 249 samples taken from these raises indicate a mean grade of 20.19g/t gold equivalent over a mean width of 1.1m and sample spacing of approximately 1.5m. Samples range from below detection to 131.36g/t and sample widths between 0.15m and 2.5m.
The gold equivalent values are based on a 1895 to 1919 gold price of USD $20.67 per troy ounce. 
Advanced statistical modelling of geochemical data is now underway in preparation for estimating the gold equivalent content of the modelled vein material. The company expects to be in a position to announce the results of this project within the coming months, once peer review of the final report is complete. It is uncertain at this stage of the Talisman Deeps project if all or parts of the mineralisation modelled will be able to be classified as mineral resources or reserves under the 2012 JORC code, due to uncertainty over verifying the quality control and assurance procedures in place at the time.,  
However, the information certainly supports the company’s view that gold mineralisation may extend to depth and that there may be some areas of vein marginal to and below historic stoping that will constitute mineral inventory.  Once the estimations are complete and the competent persons are satisfied with the level of data integrity, portions of this mineral inventory may be able to be classified as resources compliant with JORC 2012 or upgraded to JORC compliant resources. Beyond providing evidence of depth extensions of the vein system below 16 Level, work to date has identified several potential ore sources in close proximity to the No 8 Level drives which, if they can be included into the scope of the Bulk Sampling Project, is likely to have a material effect on the final Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve position of the Talisman Mine.
Rahu Update
During the reporting period Newcrest re-logged 2,200m of existing diamond drill core from within the Rahu tenure, including drill holes RHDD-01 to RHDD-11. Spectral (ASD) analysis of all drill core was also completed to identify alteration footprints of the system, and system level exposure.
The aim of the re-logging project was to:
• Provide an updated stratigraphic framework for the geological setting of Rahu. Historical datasets had over sixty (60) rock types.
• Document alteration and quartz textural variation (quartz vein mode, texture and mineral facies) throughout the project to identify the ‘boiling’ zone in the Rahu Project, and determine the more prospective part of the system for drill testing.
In addition to this Newcrest have conducted extensive engagement with local Iwi in preparation for the drilling programme to follow.
Vanuatu and other opportunities
The Company has been investigating Australasian and the Pacific opportunities to take NTL’s wholly owned subsidiary Coromandel Gold Limited into exploration and development projects. During the quarter the Company has been in discussions with an unlisted public company to look at potential opportunities that  include Vanuatu where similarities to the Coromandel and Waihi Gold Districts are recognised. 

Amer
Intermittent discussions with Amer continued during the period. Amer provided an updated non-binding proposal which was at a significant discount to the company’s current value, did not contain any premium for control, and was overly complex. We continue to discuss with Amer opportunities to work together, however, our primary focus remains the development and expansion of our mining assets.

    NPT Shareholder Update
    1:05pm, 13 Apr 2017 | S/HOLDER
  

  13 April 2017

Dear NPT Shareholder,

RE: Support for Kiwi Property Proposal from New Zealand Shareholders’ Association

Further to our correspondence regarding the Kiwi Property proposal before the company, we recently received a letter from the New Zealand Shareholder’s Association (NZSA) which we think will be of interest to all NPT shareholders.

The NZSA fulfils a valuable role in promoting the interests of shareholders in NZX listed companies. It is a member-based organisation that exists to hold companies to high standards of shareholder engagement. As such, it is a genuinely independent body.

In the attached letter to its members, the NZSA provides a very good analysis of all aspects of the Kiwi Property proposal – including a candid assessment of what it sees as being the pros and cons of various scenarios for NPT.  

After evaluating the proposal, and seeking the views of various stakeholders, the NZSA has indicated that it will vote any undirected proxies it receives in support of the Kiwi Property proposal.

Mr Midgley (Chief Executive of NZSA) noted that the NZSA was happy to accept proxies from any shareholders whether or not they were members of the Shareholders Association. He also said that shareholders that have already voted can always change their minds and submit a new vote.

The NZSA letter is attached for your information.   

The NZSA letter reinforces the NPT Board’s own view - which is supported by advice received by the NPT Board and feedback from other institutional investors - that the Kiwi Property proposal is in the best interests of NPT shareholders.  

We take this opportunity to remind all shareholders again how important it is that you exercise your right to vote in support of the future you want to see for NPT.

As is their right, two major shareholders have publicly expressed their opposition to the Kiwi Property proposal. One of these parties, Augusta Capital, has significantly increased its shareholding in NPT from 9.3% to 18.8% in the last week.  Based on Augusta’s proposal submitted to the NPT Board in October last year (which was formally withdrawn in March this year), the NPT Board expects Augusta’s ultimate goal is to be appointed as the external manager of NPT.

The special meeting is being held in Auckland at 11.00 a.m. on 21 April 2017. If you are unable to attend, we strongly urge you to submit your proxy form.  The Chairman of the NPT Board is willing to act as your proxy, as is the NZSA. You must have your proxy to our Registrar, Link Market Services, no later than 11:00 am on 19 April 2017, hence we ask for your urgent attention to this matter

Kind regards
 
Tony Sewell
Chairman 
NPT Limited

  NZX Announcement - 21 April 2017

Shareholders vote against Kiwi Property Proposal, Augusta nominees join NPT Board

At an NPT Limited (NZX: NPT) Special Shareholder’s Meeting held today, the proposal before the company from Kiwi Property Group to sell NPT two of its properties and purchase the management rights for NPT’s portfolio was not approved.

54.87% of the votes cast were against this resolution, from 23.95% of the holders by number.

As a consequence of the results of the meeting, all arrangements with Kiwi Property Group, including the sale and purchase agreements and management agreement, have now lapsed.

Shareholders voted in support of Board changes which have resulted in the removal of Tony Sewell (Chair) and Jim Sherwin, to be replaced by independent directors, Allen Bollard and Bruce Cotterill, and Augusta Chair, Paul Duffy. Carol Campbell maintains her Board position as an independent director.

“If you strip out Augusta Capital and Salt Funds Management from the voting, almost 80% of votes cast were in favour of the proposal,” said outgoing Chairman, Tony Sewell.

“However, this was not enough to carry it on the day and so we respectfully stand aside now for the incoming Board to develop its own strategy for the future of NPT.”

Ends.

    Marsden Maritime Holdings Ltd - Interim Results
    3:03pm, 27 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  Marsden Maritime Holdings Ltd (NZX:MMH) has today announced that it recorded a Net Surplus of $5.025 million (2015 - $4.141 million) for its interim, six month reporting period to 31 December 2016, representing a 21.3% improvement on the prior period result.  

MMH Chief Executive, Graham Wallace said that “the positive result was attributable to a combination of strong cargo growth at associate entity Northport Ltd and improved earnings from our other commercial operations”.

Overall cargo throughput at Northport Ltd was up 11.8% to 1.853 million tonnes (2015 -  1.658 million tonnes) with log volumes increasing by 12.6%. Non-log cargo throughput was up 8.9%.

A fully imputed dividend of 6.25 cents per share (2015/16 – 5.50 cents per share) has been declared with payment to be made on 24 March 2017.

“Although cargo volumes at Northport for the remainder of the current financial year are projected to be at a slightly lower level than that for the comparable period last year, we expect annualised throughput will still exceed that recorded in the 2016 financial year”, stated Wallace.

“This increase in cargo volumes, coupled with continued improvement in returns from our other activities, should provide an improved full year trading result”, added Chairman, Sir John Goulter.

ENDS.

    MOA TO PARTNER WITH LEWIS ROAD CREAMERY 
    12:38pm,  9 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  MOA TO PARTNER WITH LEWIS ROAD CREAMERY AS THEY ENTER THE LIQUEUR MARKET AND REAFFIRMS FY17 REVENUE GUIDANCE. 

Moa Group (NZX:MOA ) today announces it will act as the sales and distribution partner for Lewis Road Creamery as they enter the Liqueur market with their new Chocolate Cream Liqueur.  This follows Moa’s  announcement that they act as sales and distribution partner for Wellington craft brewer - ParrotDog, released in October last year. 

Moa announced at its 2016 AGM that it would consider distributing a small set of complementary brands to build scale and breadth of offer to key New Zealand Liquor groups. This may involve distribution agreements, like those with ParrotDog and Lewis Road Creamery, or acquisitions. This strategy is re affirmed as Moa heads through 2017.

Moa also confirms the FY2017 revenue guidance, given last year, of a range of $9.5 to $11.0m.  The Group will give a further market update in April.

    Cxb Monitor significantly outperforms FDA approved tests
    10:20am,  6 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  6 March 2017

CXBLADDER MONITOR SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS ALL FDA APPROVED URINE TESTS FOR BLADDER CANCER

Cxbladder Monitor clinical paper accepted for publication in Journal of Urologic Oncology

The prestigious international journal Urological Oncology, has accepted for publication a scientific and clinical paper validating the superior performance of Pacific Edge’s Cxbladder Monitor test for the surveillance of patients who are being managed following treatment for bladder cancer. This follows the recently announced acceptance for publication of the Cxbladder Monitor validation study in the American Journal of Urology. 

Titled “Clinical Comparison of Non-invasive Urine Tests for Ruling Out Recurrent Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder”, the paper compared the performance of the Cxbladder Monitor test to other commonly available urine markers and cytology for surveillance of patients with urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer). 

Specifically, the paper, based on a Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) managed study with data from over 1100 USA patient samples, found that the Cxbladder Monitor test significantly outperforms current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved urine-based monitoring tests, including cytology and UroVysion® FISH, in a large representative population undergoing surveillance for recurrent urothelial carcinoma. This supports using Cxbladder Monitor as a confirmatory negative adjunct to cystoscopy or to justify postponing cystoscopic investigations in select patients. The paper concludes that this performance signals a step change in clinical utility for urologists managing patients in a surveillance regime for recurrence of the disease.

The paper also concluded that Cxbladder Monitor provides clinicians with a greater degree of certainty when monitoring for recurrent bladder cancer, or when used as a direct rule-out test for patients identified as being at low risk for recurrent disease, thereby avoiding cystoscopies in those patients that have a negative Cxbladder Monitor result.

The paper noted that currently the major limitations in the other existing urine tests used for the monitoring of patients to date has been inadequate sensitivity, particularly for early stage and low grade tumours that account for a significant proportion of recurrences.  Cxbladder Monitor combines high sensitivity and high Negative Predictive Value (NPV), both of which are essential for an effective rule-out test, outperforming all comparator tests irrespective of the patient’s age and gender, recurrent tumour size, stage and grade, or duration post-treatment with adjuvant BCG. 

Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Edge, David Darling, commented: “Cxbladder Monitor has been highlighted in this journal for its outstanding performance in the monitoring of bladder cancer. Overall, it offers an ‘increase in clinical utility warranting consideration for inclusion in the guidelines’. As stated in the paper Cxbladder Monitor ‘significantly out performs current FDA approved urine tests used in the management of bladder cancer’. 

“Cxbladder Monitor provides an opportunity to enhance the standard of care for bladder cancer patients, making surveillance of patients with this disease and the monitoring for the recurrence of the disease, more effective and importantly for the patient, less invasive. The paper supports our strategy to provide a ‘one stop shop’ of high performance bladder cancer products designed to meet targeted clinical needs.” 

“Cxbladder Monitor has recently been adopted in New Zealand by the Waitemata District Health Board and added to their standard of care for evaluation of low risk patients who are presenting to the clinic for evaluation for the recurrence of the disease. For these low risk patients Cxbladder has replaced cystoscopy.”

The peer reviewed paper will be published in the online edition of Urological Oncology, which provides practical, timely, and relevant clinical and basic science information to physicians and researchers practicing urology worldwide. The print copy publication will be available on the next edition of the Journal.

Cxbladder Monitor, sensitivity of 0.93 and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 0.97, was launched in New Zealand in December 2015, and late 2016 in the USA following acceptance for publication of the clinical validation study. It is the third of Pacific Edge’s cancer diagnostic tests, as the company continues to build its ‘one stop shop’ of accurate and non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests. Cxbladder Triage helps to rule out cancer in patients who have a low probability of having urothelial cancer; Cxbladder Detect is used specifically to detect bladder cancer; and Cxbladder Monitor provides urologists who are evaluating patients for the recurrence of the disease, with greater certainty of their clinical evaluations, and patients with a non-invasive way to monitor their disease.

The company is developing and commercialising its range of Cxbladder bladder cancer tests globally through its wholly owned central laboratories in New Zealand and the USA. The company’s products have been tested and validated in international multi-centre clinical studies. 

Pacific Edge has three proprietary, novel, accurate, molecular diagnostic products in-market providing actionable results, and better detection and management of urothelial cancer. Cxbladder Detect and Cxbladder Triage are available through the company’s dedicated CLIA certified laboratories for customers in New Zealand, Australia and the USA. Cxbladder Monitor launched in New Zealand in December 2015 and is anticipated being available in the US in 2016.

ABOUT Cxbladder Triage www.cxbladder.com
Cxbladder Triage combines the power of the genomic biomarkers with additional phenotypic and clinical risk factors to accurately identify patients with haematuria who have a low probability of bladder cancer and may not require a more extensive urological evaluation. Cxbladder Triage is a tool for use by clinicians and physicians in primary evaluation of patients with haematuria and is intended to reduce the need for an expensive and invasive work-up in patients who have a low probability of having urothelial carcinoma.

ABOUT Cxbladder Detect www.cxbladder.com
Cxbladder Detect enables the non-invasive detection of bladder and other urinary tract cancers from a small volume of a patients’ urine. Cxbladder Detect was launched in 2013 in the USA and is commercially available in New Zealand, Australia and the USA as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) from the company’s CLIA certified laboratories. Cxbladder Detect provides clinicians with a quick, cost effective and accurate measure of the presence of the cancer as an effective adjunct to cystoscopy.

ABOUT Cxbladder Monitor www.cxbladder.com
Cxbladder Monitor, the third test in the Cxbladder portfolio for urologists, is a proprietary, non-invasive, molecular diagnostic test that combines genomic biomarkers measured from a small quantity of a patient’s urine, with patient specific clinical factors to better monitor bladder cancer patients for recurrence. Bladder cancer has a recurrence rate of 50-80% and requires life-long surveillance. Cxbladder Monitor accurately identifies patients with a prior history of urothelial cancer (UC) whose Cxbladder Monitor score shows that they have a low probability of recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Cxbladder Monitor is designed to be used as the preferred adjunct test to cystoscopy in the management of patients for ongoing evaluation of recurrent bladder cancer.

  13 March 2017

Resignation of Chief Executive

The directors of Promisia Integrative Ltd. (PIL.NZX) announced today that the company’s Chief Executive, Mr Charles Daily, has resigned.  Mr Daily has been in the role of CEO for four years during which time the sales of the company’s product, Arthrem, have grown from a nominal amount to  becoming the top selling product in New Zealand pharmacies in dollar terms.  The company has also seen its market capitalization increase by over 200% during this time period.

Mr. Daily said he felt it was time to pursue other business interests and also felt the company was on solid ground for continued growth.  The successful rights issue in December 2016 combined with the current turnover has put the company in a strong position.  

Chairman, Stephen Underwood, thanked Mr Daily for his contribution to the development of the company and wished him well for the future. Mr Underwood said that sales for the first two months were well ahead of same months of 2016.  Promisia is well placed with stock to supply its customers and continue growth in sales of Arthrem in New Zealand. The company will proceed as soon as possible with its plans to launch Arthrem in Australia and launch its canine product in New Zealand. 

While the search for a new CEO is underway the company’s directors, particularly Mr Tom Brankin, will provide management services to the company.  The company has also added a management accountant, Ms Donna Campbell, to its executive team.

    Port of Tauranga Half Year Results (Dec 2016)
    8:30am, 23 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  Port of Tauranga On Track for One Million Containers (TEUs) 

FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO 31 DECEMBER 2016
Half year net profit rises to $41.9 million from $38.6 million as the country’s premier freight gateway benefits from rising cargo volumes and continues to set standards for port productivity  

Highlights:
• Revenue for the six months to 31 December 2016 rises 2.8% to $125.3 million and net profit rises 8.5% to $41.9 million
• Total trade increases 8% from 10.1 million tonnes to 11.0 million tonnes for the period 
• Container volumes rise 8% to 510,074 TEUs, reinforcing Port of Tauranga’s position as New Zealand’s largest container terminal
• On track to handle more than one million TEUs in the 2017 financial year - a first for a New Zealand port   
• Imports increase by 7% in volume while exports increased 21% as log volumes recover
• Interim dividend of 5 cents per share - up 8.7%  on the prior year’s figure

New Zealand’s largest freight gateway Port of Tauranga today announced it is on track to become the first port in the country to transport more than one million containers across its wharves in a single year.

It also announced a strong 8.5% improvement in Group half year net profit to $41.9 million from $38.6 million in the same period a year ago, as half year trade volumes grew 8% to 11.0 million tonnes and the Port continued to set new national standards for port productivity. 

Half year Group revenue increased 2.8% to $125.3 million. 

The Port of Tauranga Board has declared an interim dividend of five cents per share - up 8.7% on the prior year’s interim dividend1. The record date is 10 March and the payment date is 24 March 2017.
 
Chairman David Pilkington said: “Our results show the Port of Tauranga is continuing to reinforce its position as the country’s premier freight gateway. We have lifted revenue and earnings and moved record cargo volumes including more than 510,000 TEU containers.

“Exporters, importers and the shipping lines are increasingly recognising the benefits of our deep water port and our efficient freight handling and stevedoring operations.

“In the 2017 financial year, we expect to become the first New Zealand port to handle more than one million containers in a 12 month period. This achievement is the direct result of our now-completed five-year $350 million infrastructure investment programme, which has extended the Port’s freight  hinter-land across the country, prepared the port for large ships and provided importers and exporters with highly-efficient routes to the country’s most important markets. 

“Our world-class infrastructure will benefit the New Zealand economy for years to come,” Mr Pilkington said.     

Chief Executive Mark Cairns said: “We are consolidating our position as the port of choice for international shipping lines, with ship visits in the six-month period rising 4% to 774 from 741 in the same period last year.

“Following the completion of our harbour dredging programme in September 2016, Maersk introduced a large vessel service, with Tauranga as its only New Zealand call.  The 9,500 TEU Aotea Maersk has been a regular visitor since October.

“Meanwhile, Hamburg Sud last month announced it will introduce in March a big ship, peak season weekly service, with Tauranga as its only New Zealand call. The largest cruise ship ever to visit the Bay of Plenty - the 4,700 passenger, 1,600 crew Ovation of the Seas - also made its maiden voyage to Tauranga on Boxing Day and has made a couple of further calls since.

“It is pleasing to see shipping lines take advantage of the possibilities created by the harbour dredging programme to bring in larger vessels. The economies of scale that come with larger ships drive transport efficiencies and ensure New Zealand exporters retain direct routes to international markets.   

“With bigger ships calling at Tauranga, we are handling significantly larger volumes of cargo per shipment. We continue to lead the way in setting productivity standards for the New Zealand port industry and we strive to look at all aspects of the container terminal operations to ensure that we remain cost-effective.”

Ministry of Transport (MOT) figures from the fourth quarter of the 2016 calendar year show a crane rate for the quarter of 35.9 container transfers per hour, compared with the weighted national average of 33.7 moves per hour.

“Our ship service rate was 89.8 container exchanges per hour per ship, compared with the national weighted average of 76.9.   Such strong results, which rank Port of Tauranga in the top tier of Australasia’s most productive ports, are not only good for our shareholders, they are also in the best interests of the New Zealand freight industry,” Mr Cairns said.
 
During the half year period, Port of Tauranga invested $43.9 million in new infrastructure to further increase storage capacity and productivity. The investments included final payments on the two new gantry cranes commissioned, thirteen new straddle carriers and several property developments at the container terminal. 

A new purpose-built shed is nearing completion and will be used by Oji Fibre Solutions (formerly Carter Holt Harvey) as a distribution hub, clearing the way for Oji’s former facility to be demolished and new container slots established to further enhance container terminal efficiency.

Traffic from our inland hubs continues to grow, with the numbers of containers transferred by rail between Tauranga and our MetroPort facility in Auckland increasing 20% compared with the first half of the previous financial year.

Cargo trends

Export volumes increased 9% to 7.1 million tonnes and import volumes increased 7% to 3.9 million tonnes.  Overall, trade increased 8% to 11 million tonnes. Containers handled increased 8% to 510,074 TEUs. Trans-shipped containers (containers transferred between vessels at Tauranga) increased 2% to 75,583 TEUs.

Log exports rebounded from the previous corresponding period, increasing 21% in volume to nearly three million tonnes.  Other forest products had mixed results, with pulp volumes up slightly (3%) to 291,000  tonnes but paper products were down 8% to 273,000 tonnes.

Dairy product exports increased 4% to 1,088,000 tonnes. Kiwifruit volumes increased 16% to just over 477,000 tonnes, a trend which is expected to continue for the next few years as the industry recovers from the PSA virus. 

Other produce varied in volumes, with frozen meat exports decreasing by 25%, apples increased by 6%, and onions decreased by 23%.  Oil imports increased 10% in volume.

Fertiliser imports increased 10% and there was steady growth in other import categories, such as dry chemicals (up 13%), bulk liquids (up 13%), cement (up 5%) and salt (up 14%). Food supplement imports for the dairy industry decreased 10%, and grain volumes fell close to 20%.

Subsidiary/Associate Companies

Subsidiary and Associate profits were up slightly on last year to $8.04 million. In particular, Northport, and Coda had strong performances. 

Outlook

Port of Tauranga is well positioned for the remainder of the financial year and beyond. The arrival of the Hamburg Sud service in March should provide a further boost to container volumes and ensure the Company reaches the milestone of handling more than one million TEUs annually by the end of the financial year in June.

Given the strong first half result, we expect earnings for the 12 months to 30 June 2017 to be at the upper end of our previous guidance of $79 million to $83 million, provided there are no significant changes to market conditions.

  Pumpkin Patch appoints Administrators

It is with considerable regret that the Board of Pumpkin Patch Limited has placed the company into Voluntary Administration under Part 15A of the Companies Act 1993.

The Board believes that the company's executive team has made significant progress last year in the four-year turnaround programme in a challenging retail market. That progress has continued in the first quarter of this financial year.

However, despite considerable efforts by the Board and its management team, it has become evident that no solution is available to the company, at this time, to address the current over-leveraged and significantly capital constrained position.

With no likely solution available, the Board believes that the constraints currently experienced by the business are too great and the only appropriate action to best protect the interests of stakeholders is to appoint administrators.

The board has therefore appointed Andrew Grenfell and Conor McElhinney of McGrathNicol as administrators for Pumpkin Patch and a number of its subsidiaries.  The Board understands its bank has appointed Neale Jackson and Brendon Gibson of KordaMentha as receivers. The Board is committed to work with both administrators and receivers to obtain the best possible outcome for the company and its staff.

The Board would like to thank the Company's many dedicated staff, suppliers and business partners for their on-going support.

  22 February 2017

Resignation of Sir Peter Maire from the Board of Rakon

Rakon today announces the resignation of Sir Peter Maire from the Board of Rakon Limited (NZX: RAK).

Sir Peter has been a director of Rakon for the past 16 years and with his well-known technical knowledge and skills has made major contributions to the company.

Sir Peter said, “my decision to leave the Board now is because my other business interests are demanding much more of my time and with the arrival of Siward as a high quality major shareholder and potential future business partner, my specific skills are well replaced by their involvement”. 

Rakon’s Chairman, Bryan Mogridge paid tribute to Sir Peter and his input around the Board table, in wishing him well for the future.

As has been previously noted, Rakon is in the process of selecting and appointing new directors. These new director appointments are expected to be made in the next few weeks.

The Board confirms that it remains compliant with Listing Rule 3.3.1, whereby the Board contains the required number of independent directors for the composition of the Board. These are re-confirmed as Bryan William Mogridge (Independent Chairman) and Bruce Robertson Irvine (Independent Director).

    Half Year Results Announcement
    8:30am, 21 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  PGG Wrightson announces solid first half performance and increase in full year net profit after tax forecast.

PGG Wrightson Ltd* (PGW) has announced today that at the half-year it remains on track to deliver its full-year result in line with earlier guidance.

For the six-months ended 31 December 2016, PGW achieved Operating EBTIDA** of $26.0 million, down $5.0 million from the strong result in the corresponding period last year.  Net profit after tax for the period was $16.0 million, broadly in line with the corresponding period last year.
   
PGW Chairman Alan Lai said, “The Board and I are pleased PGW is meeting its budgets through these challenging trading conditions.  As we foreshadowed, the lower confidence seen in the dairy sector through calendar 2015 and the first half of 2016 has impacted earnings.  In that context this is a very pleasing result for the period given the market conditions.” 

PGW’s Board declared an interim dividend of 1.75 cents per share, which will be paid to shareholders registered at the record date of 10 March 2017.  The dividend will be fully imputed and paid to shareholders on 4 April 2017.  

PGW Chief Executive Mark Dewdney said, “We expected the tougher trading environment would mean a dip in earnings for the first half of the year.  While there are some key trading months still ahead of us we remain on track to deliver a full year Operating EBITDA in the $62 million to $68 million range as signalled in October last year. In addition, we now expect full year net profit after tax to be higher than last year - in the range of $46 million to $51 million.  This increase is due to several non-operating gains we expect to realise in the second half of the year, such as gains on property we plan to sell.

“We continue to operate well in New Zealand and across our other markets.  This first half result was affected by the continued caution of dairy farm spending across the New Zealand market - this caution has slowed irrigation development which impacts our Water business.  However we look toward the second half of the financial year, which is traditionally the strongest trading period for us, with some optimism that we will see the impact of improving sentiment in the dairy sector.  In particular, the early signals are positive for re-grassing and seed demand to pick up in the autumn.”

Commenting on the results, Mark Dewdney explained, “Low dairy prices, reduced production of both dairy and red meat, tough wool trading conditions, and a wet start to spring led to cautious spending from New Zealand’s farming customers during the six months to 31 December 2016.  These trading conditions led to a 2% decline in revenue. Despite this, net profit after tax remained broadly unchanged against the prior corresponding period.

“We benefit from our diversified business portfolio.  This half year our Water and Wool businesses had softer earnings versus the corresponding period last year.  Our New Zealand Seeds business was also back slightly, but our other business units all performed at or better than the previous corresponding period. 

“Retail increased Operating EBITDA by $2.0 million compared to the previous year.  Margins also showed an increase year-on-year.  Despite some challenges with weather and competitor activity all three business areas: Rural Supplies, Fruitfed and Agritrade contributed to the strong Retail result.

“Our Livestock business maintained last year’s Operating EBITDA for the first half despite tallies for all stock and sales channels being down 1% on last year.  This drop in activity is in line with the year-on-year drop in national lamb and mutton kill.  

“Seed and Grain’s Operating EBITDA was back on the same period last year by $1.7 million.  While the South American business had a promising start to the year and the Australian business delivered a steady performance for the first six months, this was offset by a number of factors in the New Zealand market, including a more cautious spend from our dairy and dairy-related clients.

“Our continued focus on cash flow means our balance sheet remains strong, with lower levels of working capital and lower net interest bearing debt of $156.2m compared with our net interest bearing debt at December 2015 of $167.4m.”  

Looking ahead, Mark Dewdney said, “PGW is maintaining its 2017 full year Operating EBITDA guidance.  Overall, confidence in commodity markets is generally higher compared with recent years.  As referenced earlier, dairy prices have staged a welcome recovery over the last five months.  Beef prices show some signs of stabilising at good levels – down on the peaks of 2014 and 2015, admittedly, but still good by historic standards.  Sheep meat prices also seem to be stabilising.  Horticulture continues to go from strength to strength – as recently as December the Ministry for Primary Industries forecast that horticulture will maintain around 5% export revenue growth per annum into the foreseeable future.  We are also seeing encouraging signs of recovery in Uruguay as they look to put the floods of 2016 behind them.

“On the other side of the ledger, international wool prices have fallen approximately 50% over the past six months, with the consequence that we are seeing a reduction in bales sold.  

“Overall, we expect trading conditions will improve for us for the remainder of this financial year.  The really pleasing thing is that PGW has continued to perform consistently through the demanding conditions. It is a credit to our people and a positive indicator that reflects well on the value that we deliver to our customers, whatever the market conditions. It’s been a while since we’ve felt the wind at our backs, and the early indications for our 2018 financial year are looking encouraging. Our 2016 earnings were outstanding – I’m confident that 2018 can be even better.”

    Torchlight Fund LP Independent Valuation
    11:56am, 21 Feb 2017 | GENERAL
  

  21 February 2017 

Torchlight Fund LP Independent Valuation

Pyne Gould Corporation (“PGC”) Managing Director George Kerr said today that the Torchlight Fund LP’s (“TFLP”) net fund valuation is now AUD381.8 million (around NZD406 million), up from AUD283.7million (around NZD302.5 million) previously.  This increase was due to the receipt of expert opinion from Duff &amp; Phelps, a leading global valuer and corporate advisor, in respect of TFLP’s primary assets, Mr Kerr said. 

PGC has an ownership in TFLP through direct limited partner interests of 44.2%. However the increased valuation is not expected to have a flow on impact on PGC’s consolidated financial statements which are calculated using a different methodology. The net fund valuation for TFLP reflects going concern valuations whereas PGC’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals in New Zealand (NZ GAAP) and the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 and comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS).

    PGC Preliminary Half Year Results to 31 December 2016
    5:34pm, 28 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  PGC Preliminary Half Year Results to 31 December 2016

Profit and Loss 

Pyne Gould Corporation (“PGC”) Managing Director George Kerr said today PGC recorded an unaudited Net Profit attributable to security holders of GBP2.26 million for the half year to 31 December 2016 (compared with a Net Loss after Tax of GBP1.064 million in the half year to 31 December 2015).

After favourable non-cash movements in foreign currency reserves PGC recorded Total Comprehensive Income for the half year to 31 December 2016 of GBP8.84 million (up from Total Comprehensive Loss of GBP3.94 million in half year to 31 December 2015).

Balance Sheet

Mr Kerr said operating profit and foreign exchange gains lifted Net Tangible Assets (NTA) to GBP59.787 million (up from GBP50.805 million a year earlier). Accordingly NTA per share rose to 28.82 pence per share at 31 December 2016 (up from 24.49 pence per share).
On a consolidated basis PGC held Total Assets of GBP164.3 million at 31 December 2016 (up from GBP155.1 million last year). This was made up of current assets of GBP52.697 million (GBP67.849 million) and long-term assets of GBP111.6 million (GBP87.245 million). PGC had Total Liabilities of GBP54.057 million at 31 December 2016 (GBP58.557 million) and Total Equity of GBP110.224 million (up from GBP96.537 million).
After allowing for non-controlling interests of GBP50.457 million (GBP45.732 million), PGC’s NTA was GBP59.787 million (GP50.805 million).
PGC's liquidity profile improved sharply as debt was paid down and extended with Net Current Assets rising to GBP45.222 million at 31 December 2016 (up from GBP11.349 million at 31 December 2015).

Commentary

PGC remains focused on the long run success of Torchlight Fund LP (“TFLP”) in which PGC has an ownership in TFLP through direct limited partner interests of 44.2%.

After the sale in November 2015 of Local World, TFLP’s primary assets are a cornerstone stake in ASX-listed Lantern Hotel Group (“LTN”) and 100% of residential land investor RCL.

LTN has largely completed its sale program of its freehold pub portfolio in Australia and is in the process of settling contracted sales and incrementally distributing cash to shareholders, the largest of which is TFLP, which expects to receive in excess of AUD30m from this source in the coming financial year.

The largest investment of TFLP is RCL. RCL holds a land bank of circa 4000 sites across Australia and New Zealand, including Hanley Downs near Queenstown.  Hanley Downs was successfully rezoned in the third quarter of 2016 and has begun the process of unlocking cash value over time.  The first stages of this project were released to the market in the latter part of 2016 with 175 sections selling in line with list prices on release. The near term focus within RCL remains on continuing to progress this project.

As advised last week, TFLP’s net fund valuation is now AUD381.8 million (around NZD406 million), up from AUD283.7million (around NZD302.5 million) previously. This increase was due to the receipt of expert opinion from Duff &amp; Phelps, a leading global valuer and corporate advisor, in respect of TFLP’s primary remaining assets.

However, the increased valuation does not impact on PGC’s consolidated financial statements which are calculated using a different methodology. The net fund valuation for TFLP reflects going concern valuations whereas (as advised in the 2016 annual report) PGC’s financial statements are consolidated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals in New Zealand (NZ GAAP) and the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, and comply with the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS).The accounting standards require PGC to hold inventories at the lower of cost or valuation, and gains are, therefore, over the life of each project and are reflected in PGC’s profit and loss.

Non-Core Assets

Following the in specie of Heartland in 2011, PGC has exited substantially all non-core assets to focus on the growth of TFLP. The material residual receivable is final consideration from the exit of Perpetual Trust Limited (“PTL”) and independently valued at NZ$20.88 million. 

TFLP Litigation

PGC has been involved with a number of large and complex litigations as it seeks to defend and grow value for shareholders. We have previously advised the market of litigation involving TFLP where a minority of Limited Partners have sought an early termination of the Partnership. We expect to provide an update on this litigation in the near future.

NZX listed industrial property landlord Property for Industry Limited (PFI, the company) today announced record results for the year ended 31 December 2016.

“Persistence and patience” is PFI Chairman Peter Masfen’s summary of 2016. “We’ve maintained our focus on industrial property, concentrated on extracting value from strong Auckland demand, and watched and waited for favourable investment opportunities. A record profit, but— more importantly— another year of PFI delivering on its promise: consistent, long-term performance and strong, stable returns.”

Financial performance (refer appendix 1)
Operating revenues for the year increased by $4.2 million or 6.2% over the prior year to $71.1 million, as increases due to acquisitions ($2.0 million), completed developments and rentalised capital expenditure ($1.4 million) and positive leasing activity ($1.3 million) were partially offset by decreases due to disposals ($0.5 million).

Operating expenses for the year of $28.0 million were down $2.4 million or 7.9%. A reduction in interest expense and bank fees of $1.6 million, driven by a reduction in the weighted average cost of debt of almost 50 basis points, was responsible for the majority of this reduction, but reductions in non-recoverable property costs (decrease of $0.5 million) and management fees (decrease of $0.3 million) also contributed. As a result of these decreases, the ratio of operating expenses to operating revenues reduced to 39.3% from 45.4%.

PFI’s effective current tax rate for the year, being the ratio of current taxation to operating earnings, remained static at 19.8% (2015: 19.6%).

Non-operating income and expenses, which, for the most part, comprised an $88.2 million fair value gain on investment properties, were more than double the amount in prior year. After allowing for these non-operating income and expenses and deferred tax, the company made a record profit after tax of $123.4 million.

Distributable profit and dividends (refer appendix 2)
PFI recorded distributable profit of 7.58 cents per share for the year, an increase of 0.57 cents per share or 8.1% over the prior year (2015: 7.01 cents per share).

The PFI board has today resolved to pay a fourth quarter final cash dividend of 2.05 cents per share. The dividend will have imputation credits of 0.50 cents per share attached and a supplementary dividend of 0.23 cents per share will be paid to non-resident shareholders. The record date for the dividend is 27 February 2017 and the payment date is 8 March 2017. The dividend reinvestment scheme (DRS) will not operate for this dividend.

The fourth quarter final dividend will take cash dividends for the year to 7.35 cents per share, an increase of 0.05 cents per share over the prior year, resulting in a dividend pay-out ratio of 97% (2015: 106%).

Guidance
PFI Chairman Peter Masfen said: “Looking to 2017, we expect distributable profit before management performance fees, if any, to be between 7.50 and 7.70 cents per share, subject as always to economic conditions.”

The company has, for the first time, today released an analysis of Funds From Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), calculated in accordance with the Property Council of Australia’s best practice guidelines (3). These calculations show that PFI’s recorded FFO earnings of 7.99 cents per share and AFFO earnings of 6.95 cents per share, resulting in a FFO dividend pay-out ratio of 92% and an AFFO pay-out ratio of 106%.

Peter Masfen continued: “For some investors, FFO and AFFO earnings are important measures, as there is a belief that they help investors better understand and compare the underlying financial performance of property entities. Some investors also advocate for an AFFO dividend pay-out ratio that is less than 100%.

“That said, there are other investors for whom maintaining at least the current level of— or growing— cash dividends is more desirable.

“The PFI board is looking to balance these views by maintaining or gradually increasing cash dividends, whilst at the same time seeking to grow AFFO earnings to cover those dividends. That being the case, we expect to pay a cash dividend of at least 7.35 cents per share in 2017.”

Balance sheet
PFI’s net tangible assets per share increased during the year by 20.2 cents per share or 14.4% to 160.7 cents per share. The $88.2 million fair value gain on investment properties, discussed further in the portfolio performance section below, accounted for 19.5 cents per share of the increase, with other minor items accounting for the remaining increase of 0.7 cents per share.

Capital management
PFI carried out a number of capital management initiatives during the year to ensure that the company maintained a strong balance sheet.

The company’s DRS operated throughout the year raising $7.5 million.

In February 2016, the company’s $375 million syndicated bank loan facility was refinanced on competitive terms. Existing lenders ANZ, BNZ, CBA and Westpac committed two $187.5 million tranches until May 2020 and 2021, extending the average term to expiry to 3.8 years as at end of the year. The cost of the facilities was also reduced as part of this process.

In addition to these facilities, PFI maintained current total hedging (4) with a notional value of $313 million at an average rate of 4.31% for an average duration of 3.0 years. This current hedge rate is forecast to remain at low rates during 2017: based on current hedging and debt levels, an average of ~65% of the company’s debt will be hedged at an average rate of ~4.46% (beginning of 2016: average of ~73% hedged at an average rate of 4.61%). The fair value of this hedging – recorded on PFI’s statement of financial position – was largely unchanged at year-end (2016: liability of $10.0 million, 2015: liability of $10.4 million) despite significant volatility during the course of the year as a result of changes in market interest rates.

When combined with the syndicated bank loan facility PFI’s hedging provides the company with a weighted average cost of debt (WACOD) of 5.24% (5), which has continued to trend downwards (WACOD at December 2015: 5.71%), as historic expensive hedging rolled off during the year and was replaced with hedging at lower rates and low BKBM rates.

The company ended the year with adjusted gearing (6) of 30.1%. Following the settlement of 11 Turin Place, East Tamaki (see development, divestments and acquisition below), PFI’s gearing increased slightly to 31.0%, well within the company’s self-imposed gearing limit of 40% and bank covenants of 50%. The interest cover ratio (7) of 3.4 times was also well within bank covenants of 2.0 times.

Portfolio performance
(refer attached PDF for table)

Further to the announcement in December, PFI recorded an annual increase from independent valuations in the value of its property portfolio of $88.2 million or 8.9% to $1,083.3 million. An active year of portfolio management resulted in a number of individual property values increasing. High levels of demand for industrial property from both investors and owner occupiers, spurred on by low interest rates, also influenced the increase. As a result of the year-end valuation process, PFI’s passing yield firmed from 7.33% to 6.69%, and on a portfolio basis there is now no over or under renting.

Nearly 123,000 square metres representing 18% of PFI’s existing portfolio was leased during the year to 32 new and existing tenants for an average term of 4.9 years. More than 80% of the contract rent secured by this leasing was as a result of lease renewals with 25 PFI tenants for an average term of 4.6 years. In addition to this, seven new leases were secured for an average term of 6.7 years. Incentives required to attract and retain tenants have reduced noticeably during 2016, with an average incentive of just 0.3 months per year of lease term being recorded in 2016.

Included in the aforementioned totals was the lease of 3,872 square metres to Boxkraft at PFI’s 80 Hugo Johnston Drive property in Penrose. This property is one of the five purchased by PFI in August 2015 from Sistema Plastics, with Boxkraft’s lease commencing shortly after Sistema’s departure in January 2017.

The company also completed rent reviews on 84 leases during the year, resulting in an average annual uplift of 1.5% on $41.6 million of contract rent.

Looking forward, PFI’s near term leasing outlook remains positive: at year-end the company’s portfolio was almost 100% occupied and 11.2% of contract rent is due to expire during 2017 (as at 31 December 2015: 9.3% was due to expire during 2016). In total, ~68% of PFI’s portfolio is subject to some form of lease event during 2017, and PFI will continue to be able to access projected market rental growth as ~35% of those lease events (8) are market related.

Development, divestments and acquisition
The company’s $25.9 million development of four pre-leased bulk store facilities at 124 Hewletts Road in Mount Maunganui, was completed in June 2016 ahead of schedule and under budget. A new $1.9 million warehouse at 54 Carbine Road &amp; 6a Donnor Place, Mount Wellington was also completed during the first half of the year, with tenant commitment secured during the build process.

The sale of PFI’s non-core property at 85 Cavendish Drive, Manukau, settled in February 2016, with the funds realised from that sale being reinvested into the aforementioned developments. In December 2016, the company contracted to sell a property at 27 Zelanian Drive, East Tamaki, for a net sales price of $8.3 million. The sale of this vacant property settled subsequent to year-end on 1 February 2017.

Also subsequent to year-end, on 2 February 2017, PFI purchased an industrial property at 11 Turin Place, East Tamaki. The property is leased for 15 years to Thermakraft— a market leader in building and wall wrap, roofing underlay, and window flashing tape— and the lease provides fixed rental growth of 4.55% every two years. The property was purchased in a sale and lease back transaction for a net purchase price of $14.2 million, representing a yield on purchase of 6.5%.

Market update
ANZ estimate that the New Zealand economy grew around 3.5% over 2016, and suggest that a similar pace of annualised growth will be achieved for at least the first half of 2017. Paul Bloxham, the HSBC economist who branded New Zealand as the ""rock-star economy"" of the OECD in 2014, has said he expects the country's economy to continue to outperform many of its peers in the coming years.

This positive period of economic growth, say Colliers International, is reflected in the industrial sector. “The recurring commentary,” they say, “is the lack of stock.” Access to suitable levels of stock remains a vital ingredient for an expanding market and across the country demand is outweighing supply. They believe the medium-term outlook for the industrial sector is robust.

CBRE point out that the amount of new industrial supply that entered the market in 2016 is the largest since 2007, and they expect 2017 to be another strong year, with no significant slowdown in construction activity and with more speculative developments in the pipeline than in recent years. Nevertheless, they say given that economic forecasters have unanimously revised New Zealand’s growth prospects upwards, and because the industrial property market is highly correlated with overall GDP trends, they expect strong demand for industrial space in 2017. Consequently, they expect overall industrial vacancy to be stable in 2017 at below 2%. They also predict yields will largely be stable in 2017.

Strategy and outlook
PFI remains focused on its strategy of investing in quality industrial property in New Zealand’s main urban centres. The company will continue to drive shareholder returns by actively managing vacancy and upcoming lease expiries, opportunistically pursuing both core and value-add industrial acquisitions, maximising utilisation of the portfolio and divesting of non-core assets when value has been maximised and an opportunity to recycle capital into industrial property arises.

“Commentators are very positive about New Zealand’s economic prospects for 2017,” says Peter Masfen, “but we should not ignore their caveats: as the ANZ says, ‘the world is awash with risks and challenges’.  At PFI, we’ll take it carefully and stay focused on the long-term. That is the key to successful investing.”

    PFI - Internalisation Agreement
    8:30am,  3 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  PROPERTY FOR INDUSTRY – INTERNALISATION AGREEMENT

The Independent Directors of NZX-listed industrial property landlord, Property for Industry Limited (NZX: PFI), are pleased to announce that they have reached a conditional agreement with PFIM Limited (PFIM) to internalise the management of PFI, subject to receiving shareholder approval at a special meeting to be held in June 2017 and receipt of a binding ruling from the IRD relating to the tax treatment of the internalisation. 

The Independent Directors believe internalisation will be accretive to earnings per share for shareholders, ensure the continuity of PFI’s proven management team and strategy and ensure continued alignment of shareholder and management interests. Importantly, significant costs savings are expected to be achieved and, post internalisation, the Independent Directors expect PFI to have one of the lowest management expense ratios in the New Zealand listed property sector.  

Key features of the internalisation include:
- A payment of $42.0 million (implying a net cost for internalisation of $30.3 million post tax deductibility and before transaction costs) to PFIM as consideration for the termination of the PFI management contract and the acquisition by PFI of the business and certain assets of PFIM;
- Greg Reidy, Simon Woodhams and Craig Peirce will continue to act as Managing Director, General Manager and Chief Financial Officer respectively, under independent service contracts with PFI; and
- The offer of employment by PFI to other employees of McDougall Reidy &amp; Co Limited (to whom PFIM currently subcontracts its management function), who will continue to provide the same services currently provided to PFI.

Deloitte was commissioned by the Independent Directors to examine the valuation matters associated with the internalisation agreement. Deloitte has concluded that the internalisation is expected to be earnings per share accretive and accordingly is expected to provide a material net present value gain to shareholders. Deloitte has also determined that the purchase price is fair taking into account the very limited rights of termination in the existing management contract and the value benefits for shareholders from the transaction. 

PFIM has provided management services for PFI since late 2011 and during that time has overseen growth in the value of properties under management to $1.1 billion (comprising 84 properties of which 70 are in Auckland) while also delivering growth in earnings per share, dividends per share and net tangible assets per share. 

Peter Masfen, Chairman and Independent Director of PFI, said: “The internalisation agreement has been the result of a proactive and collaborative approach by the Board and PFIM and will ensure the full continuity of PFI’s successful business model and strategy, with the same people, the same processes and the same focus on delivering strong, stable shareholder returns.

“The existing PFIM management contract has very limited rights of termination, and internalisation will safeguard the retention of the current management team, which has significant experience and a deep understanding of the industrial property sector.

“Post internalisation, the Board expects PFI to have one of the lowest management expense ratios in the New Zealand listed property sector. The Independent Directors unanimously support the internalisation and believe that it is in the best interests of shareholders.”

The internalisation agreement is conditional on approval by PFI shareholders and receipt by PFI of a binding ruling from the IRD confirming that the proportion of the payment to PFIM relating to the termination of the PFI management contract is deductible for income tax purposes, implying a net cost for internalisation before transaction costs of $30.3 million. This payment will be funded by an expansion of PFI’s bank facilities, which will result in pro forma drawn bank debt of $364.7 million as at 31 December 2016 (which implies a pro forma gearing ratio of 33.7%(1)). To this end, a $50 million Institutional Credit facility has been established with ANZ. The facility expires on 31 July 2018 and ranks alongside PFI’s existing syndicated bank loan facility.

Northington Partners has been appointed to prepare an Independent Appraisal Report on the merits of the internalisation agreement and this report will be included in a Notice of Special Meeting which is expected to be sent to PFI shareholders in early June. The Special Meeting of shareholders is expected to be held in late June and, subject to receiving shareholder approval and a binding ruling from the IRD, settlement of the internalisation is expected to occur on 30 June 2017.

Forsyth Barr and Chapman Tripp have been appointed as financial advisor and legal advisor to the Independent Directors of PFI, respectively.

• Major new office leasing announced today with global law firm DLA Piper committing to the new PwC Tower at Commercial Bay taking pre-leasing, by income, at the new tower to 64% (Dec 15: 52%). 
• Pre-leasing across all of Precinct’s office developments is now 77%.
• In December the agreement to acquire Queen Elizabeth Square from Auckland Council became unconditional and all resource consents were obtained. 

99% portfolio occupancy and strong weighted lease term

• Leasing over the period has been strong, particularly in Wellington with overall occupancy rising to 99% (30 June 2016: 98%)
• Weighted average lease term (WALT) across the portfolio is 5.9 years (June 2016: 6.3 years), increasing further out to 8.1 years after including developments.
• Following the Kaikoura earthquake a $12 million devaluation has been booked at Deloitte House, based on provisional repair estimates.
 
Enhancing the strategy 

• We are excited to announce today the conditional acquisition of a 50% interest in co-working space operator Generator. 
• Generator is well aligned with Precinct’s strategy of being a city centre specialist. It has a strong management team and offers the opportunity to expand the market in which Precinct operates and to enhance the amenity and service levels that Precinct can offer its clients.

Precinct Properties New Zealand Limited (Precinct) (NZX: PCT) reported its six-month results to 31 December 2016 today, with a net profit after tax (NPAT) of $39.1 million. This compared with $34.8 million for the same period last year, with the increase mainly attributable to lower interest and tax expense, and a fair value gain in financial instruments. Net operating income, which adjusts for a number of non-cash items, increased $3.1 million to $38.8 million (31 December 2015: $35.7 million) or 3.20 cents per share. 

Scott Pritchard, Precinct’s CEO, said we achieved a number of milestones across our business and have significantly advanced our long term strategy.

“We committed to and commenced works at Bowen Campus in Wellington, progressed works at Commercial Bay including the demolition of the old shopping centre, enjoyed leasing success at Commercial Bay and completed the Mason Brothers building at Wynyard Quarter Stage One.” 

“The completion of the Mason Brothers Building is a major milestone for the business as it is the first project to be completed and sees Precinct begin to transform its portfolio,” he said.

Leasing momentum at Commercial Bay continues. Global law firm DLA Piper committed to 2,700 square metres within the new tower taking office pre-leasing, by income, to 64%. “Importantly this commitment comes from outside the portfolio and illustrates the attraction of this CBD waterfront precinct.” Scott Pritchard, Precinct’s CEO, said.

In December the agreement to acquire Queen Elizabeth Square from Auckland Council became unconditional. The land is now formally incorporated into the Commercial Bay retail development due to open in late 2018. This provides certainty to allow the retail leasing programme to advance responding to significant interest from retailers. 

In addition to these milestones, Precinct can today announce the conditional acquisition of a 50% interest in Generator. Generator, established in 2011, operates 3,000 square metres of co-working space over three sites within the Britomart precinct in Auckland’s CBD. 

“Generator is well aligned with Precinct’s values and its strategy of being a city centre specialist. It has a strong management team and offers the opportunity to enhance the amenity and service levels that Precinct can offer its clients. It will also enable Precinct to expand its traditional client base with smaller businesses, helping to grow occupancy and demand,” he said.

INTERIM RESULTS 

Net property income (NPI) reduced to $45.9 million (31 December 2015: $53.7 million). After adjusting for recent asset sales and foregone income associated with our development projects, like for like income was $0.7 million lower than the comparative period. This reduction was a result of the 14 November Kaikoura earthquake. After allowing for the rental abatement at Deloitte House and earthquake related costs like for like income was slightly higher than the comparative period.

Precinct’s Wellington portfolio performed very well during the earthquake with all but Deloitte House being assessed by engineers and reopened within 48 hours. 

Precinct's structural engineer, Holmes Consulting, were instructed to undertake a detailed structural investigation of Deloitte House which concluded relatively minor structural damage had occurred. Notwithstanding this, further detailed assessments have identified that the seismic strength of the building is lower than previous assessments.
An internal review of the 30 June 2016 property valuations indicated no material value movement in the period for all the assets apart from Deloitte House in Wellington. 

The provisional estimated cost associated with remediating the damage and making seismic improvements resulted in the independent valuation of Deloitte House falling by $12.1 million to $33.4 million (June 2016: $45 million).
The value of net tangible assets per share at interim balance date was $1.17 (June 2016: $1.17). Further financial information can be found within the 2017 Interim Report. You can find these at www.precinct.co.nz/interim-report-2017

DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS

Wynyard Quarter Stage One   
The Mason Brothers building reached practical completion fully leased in December. Mason Brothers, valued at $35.9 million, is leased to Warren and Mahoney, ATEED and Mott McDonald on a WALT of 8.4 years. 

The Innovation Building (Building 5A) is expected to be completed in July 2017. Overall Stage One is now 100% leased on an average lease term of 10.5 years and is expected to deliver a return on cost of at least 15%.

Commercial Bay 

Following the commitment by DLA Piper, the new PwC Tower is now 64% leased by income (Dec 15: 52%) on a WALT of 13.3 years. This commitment takes the amount of space secured outside the portfolio to 8,000 square metres or around a third of committed leases. Interest in the retail centre remains strong and we look forward to sharing more leasing success during 2017 following the unconditional acquisition of Queen Elizabeth Square.

Construction is progressing well. Demolition of the old Downtown Shopping Centre is now complete. Excavation, retaining and piling have all commenced and are expected to be largely complete by the middle of 2017. 

Bowen Campus

Works at Bowen Campus commenced in November. The first phase of construction will include the demolition of fixtures and fittings and the removal of the original facade. 

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

Leasing over the period has been strong with overall occupancy rising to 99% (30 June 2016: 98%). This was mainly the result of new leases in 157 Lambton Quay and HSBC House. The Auckland portfolio continues to perform well with occupancy maintained at 100%.

Over the 6 months to 31 December 2016, Precinct secured 18 new leases covering 7,354 square metres. This included securing Dimension Data in 157 Lambton Quay, maintaining a strong portfolio WALT of 5.9 years. Vacant space over the 6 months has been significantly reduced, with around 1,000 square metres of office space remaining.

Precinct settled 41 rent reviews during the period, covering an area of 50,855 square metres. These resulted in a 3.8% uplift on passing rent, and 2.6 % increase on valuation rents at 30 June 2016.

At 31 December Precinct’s WALT across the investment portfolio was 5.9 years, increasing to 8.1 years when the development pre-leasing is included (June 2016: 6.3 &amp; 8.2 years). This strong investment portfolio WALT includes the recently opened Mason Brothers Building.

OFFICE MARKET UPDATE 

The overall Auckland CBD office vacancy rate remains at historically low levels. The Auckland prime CBD office vacancy rate decreased during the six months to December 2016, down to 2.6% (June 2016: 3.3%). 

The Wellington prime CBD office vacancy rate has also decreased significantly as a result of earthquake and non-earthquake related leasing and confirmation of Government leasing. According to the latest survey, prime vacancy decreased to 1.0% (June 2016: 3.4%). 

DIVIDEND PAYMENT

Precinct shareholders will receive a second-quarter dividend of 1.40 cents per share plus imputation credits of 0.1855 cents per share. Offshore investors will receive an additional supplementary dividend of 0.08419 cents per share to offset non-resident withholding tax. The record date is 2 March 2017. Payment will be made on 16 March 2017. 
 
OUTLOOK

Full-year operating earnings after tax are expected to be around 6.2 cents per share (before performance fees). While earnings are expected to be impacted by rental abatement at Deloitte House, this is currently expected to be largely offset by stronger occupancy elsewhere in the Wellington portfolio.  Dividend guidance for the 2017 financial year remains unchanged at 5.6 cents per share.

    Significant Increase In Clinical Utility From Use of CXB
    10:39am, 15 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  An international study demonstrates compelling changes in urologists’ clinical decisions, with use of Cxbladder Triage and Cxbladder Detect leading to fewer total tests and less invasive procedures, implying a reduction in healthcare costs and an improved experience and outcome for patients.

Cancer diagnostics company, Pacific Edge Limited (NZX: PEB), is pleased to announce the approval for publication of an international study showing the significant increase in clinical utility derived from the inclusion of both Cxbladder Triage and Cxbladder Detect in the urologists’ diagnostic procedures. 

The study demonstrated the compelling changes to clinical decision making by urologists when provided with Cxbladder results for patients presenting with haematuria (blood in the urine) for detection of the presence of urothelial cancer (bladder cancer). 

Both Cxbladder Triage and Cxbladder Detect were evaluated in the clinical utility study which involved 396 clinician by patient interactions and totalled 792 separate clinical decisions. Urologists first recommended a selection of tests and procedures for patients based on referral data; they were then given the data from the Cxbladder Triage and Detect tests and their initial recommendations were reviewed and amended. 

All of the urologists changed their diagnostic recommendations once they assessed the Cxbladder results ranging from 1 to 100% of the patient cases. This led to a reduction of 25% in the total number of diagnostic procedures for patients, including a 31% reduction in invasive tests, following inclusion of both the Triage and Detect results for those patients. 

The study concludes that the use of Cxbladder provides a significant increase in clinical utility by focusing the use of specific diagnostic procedures to appropriate patients, resulting in a reduction of both the total number of procedures and the number of invasive procedures used in clinical management of patients who present to the clinic with haematuria for evaluation of urothelial cancer. This therefore improves both the diagnostic experience and outcomes for clinicians and patients alike. 

CEO of Pacific Edge, David Darling, said: “These findings are of material importance to all clinicians involved in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, and are of particular relevance to payers and funders of healthcare, such as the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid. Cxbladder provides solutions that not only improve the patients’ experience and outcome, but also enable the reallocation of appropriate diagnostic procedures, particularly expensive and invasive procedures. There is also the potential for a significant reduction in the total cost to healthcare payers by reducing the number of diagnostics procedures required.

“Changing clinical behaviour is not simple, however, in this study, overwhelmingly, clinicians made significant changes and reallocations of their diagnostic procedures when provided with the Cxbladder results.  

“Clinical and scientific papers such as these are an important part of our commercial strategy and essential in validating our products with major healthcare providers and funders in the United States, which is our primary focus.” 

This is the first time the clinical utility of both Cxbladder Triage and Cxbladder Detect combined, has been evaluated. The paper has been approved for publication in the Advances in Therapy Journal, an international, peer reviewed, journal dedicated to the publication of high-quality clinical, observational, real-world, and health outcomes research around the discovery, development, and use of therapeutics and interventions (including devices) across all therapeutic areas.

The publication of this study follows on from two other recently published studies announced by Pacific Edge. In December 2016, a study on Cxbladder Monitor was accepted for publication in the Journal of Urology, followed by acceptance of a second clinical paper on Cxbladder Monitor being accepted by the Urological Oncology journal in March 2017.   Both of these studies confirmed the superior performance of Cxbladder Monitor for the surveillance of bladder cancer recurrence with the second of these papers showing that Cxbladder Monitor outperformed all compared, FDA approved urine tests. 

Pacific Edge is the only company in the word to have a suite of four molecular diagnostic tests for the detection, management and monitoring of bladder cancer. Cxbladder Triage helps to rule out cancer in patients who have a low probability of having urothelial cancer; Cxbladder Detect is used specifically to detect bladder cancer; and Cxbladder Monitor provides urologists who are evaluating patients for the recurrence of the disease, with greater certainty of their clinical evaluations, and patients with a non-invasive way to monitor their disease. Cxbladder Resolve is the latest product to be launched, providing urologists with a frontline tool for identifying patients with high grade and late stage disease.

    10:17am, 11 Apr 2017 | ADDRESS
  

  Opus International Consultants Limited 
Annual Meeting 11 April 2017 

Chief Executive's Address 

Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

Today I’ll be talking about three main areas
First up, last year’s results.
I’ll then follow that with details of our new strategy
And finally, I’ll provide a brief overview on performance year to date

As the Chairman rightly said, while performance last year was disappointing, with Operating Revenue down 7%, we accelerated the implementation of our global growth strategy, and we’re starting to see the benefits. Importantly, after a very poor first half, we implemented a number of measures resulting in a much improved second half performance and that momentum has continued into this year – but more on that later. 

Health and Safety is at the heart of everything we do and we continue to build a strong positive culture. 2016 saw further improvement with lost time incidents reduced by 30% – and I’ll come back to that later as well.
But first I’d like to talk about last year’s financial performance in a bit more detail. 

In 2016, New Zealand had a record performance in terms of Operating EBIT.

Despite tighter procurement and more competition, we have secured 10 of the 19 Network Outcome Contracts with the NZ Transport Agency. This is critical as this represents long term multi-year contracts stabilising our revenue base and providing a sound platform for continued performance.

Our Operating EBIT for the year was an all-time record $36.9m, with an impressive Operating EBIT margin of 13.2%.  Gross revenue was up slightly by 1.1% on the prior year and work in hand remained steady as we secured contracts with many key clients, including for example, a seven year services contract with Wellington Water, and architectural services for the Ministry of Social Development.

In the United Kingdom, our progress has been recognised through the many industry accolades we’ve received. Remember, this was a business hit hard by the GFC in 2009 &amp; 2010, yet here we are now celebrating being named Company of the Year out of the top 100 global consultancy companies by New Civil Engineer. This prestigious award has materially raised our profile in the United Kingdom with potential clients and top talent. 

Our business in the United Kingdom saw an 8.4% increase in revenue in local currency. However, operating EBIT decreased by half a million, mainly as a result of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and higher staff costs in an increasingly competitive environment. We will continue to monitor the situation closely however, the business continues to grow well in the transportation sector and we recruited 24 new FTEs to tackle contracts won in the year with Network Rail, MTR Crossrail and Hertfordshire County Council amongst others.

Our result in North America was unfortunately dominated by the ongoing decline in oil and gas related work. Opus Stewart Weir, our geomatics business in Canada, saw revenue fall by $31.5m.  As a result, we dramatically reduced our workforce by 173 people and consequently our cost base.

Downsizing the business resulted in surplus office space with property lease provisions of $2.4m. However, this is purely a timing cost and will reverse against future property lease payments.

We moved swiftly to mitigate the effects of reduced opportunities by applying the same hard lessons learned in the United Kingdom in 2009/2010 to turn our Canadian geomatics business around from a $5.1m trading loss in the first half to a profitable second half of $2m. However with the continued activity in OSW at record low levels, we continue to monitor the situation closely.

Opportunities in Australia remain patchy and highly competitive as the economy continues to slowly improve following the recent downturn. As a result our performance continues to disappoint and we posted a $4.7m Operating EBIT loss. We took further measures to sharpen and focus the business last year with growth now centred on the main urban areas and particularly NSW and Victoria. As a result we closed a further five offices incurring a restructuring cost of $1.1m. Excluding these items, measures put into the business saw underlying trading performance improve by half a million dollars year on year.

Despite the improvements in the second half in Canada and the measures taken in Australia, given the continued difficult business environments we reassessed the value of our operations and impaired the carrying value of our Canadian asset by $33.2m and our Australian asset by $4.4m. 

Elsewhere, trading and opportunities in the MENA region are no longer considered to be supportive of profitable growth and as a result a $1.1m provision was taken for the write-off of business set up costs. 

So despite some positive aspects, particularly in the second half of the year, there is no hiding the fact that overall, our result was very disappointing and certainly not what we wanted.  

However, there are areas of encouragement going forward. We must remember in 2016 we were also implementing the new global growth strategy – moving from a local geographic focus to a global market sector focus. This is a fundamental change for us, ultimately ensuring that we prioritise bidding and delivery of projects using the best resources wherever they are located. 
In the past, this was difficult as there was undue ownership and priority given to local resources working on local projects meaning more material strategic opportunities were sometimes missed.

We have now refocused and prioritised effort into three global growth sectors Buildings, Water and Transportation - breaking down geographic silos and repositioning ourselves as one connected global business.

We’ve strengthened our leadership in key areas through the external appointment of Lee Arasu Group Director, Buildings and Paul Casamento Group Director, Transportation. Both have significant experience, knowledge and capability in prior senior roles and have been brought in specifically to lead our transformation and grow revenue.

In North America we have established a bridge engineering team now securing work locally and supporting other teams around the world on major bridge and transportation projects.  

Canada is becoming our centre for water excellence combined with our award-winning training and development facility here in New Zealand. This borderless collaboration is helping us win more projects, such as providing increased Wastewater consultation services for Metro Vancouver.

In a very significant move, we combined the leadership of our New Zealand and Australian operations last year, reducing costs and improving efficiency but as importantly, leveraging our capability, driving better collaboration and ensuring consistency across both countries. We have just appointed a senior leader from outside the industry, Ian Blair. Ian brings many years of experience from a number of senior executive roles he has held primarily in the banking sector and will bring a new perspective as the Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand.

With the alignment of our Australian and New Zealand businesses we continued to rationalise the number of P&amp;Ls across the company from over 200 to 3 market sectors, simplifying reporting and strengthening accountability, allowing our people to spend more time focusing on our clients rather than non-value added administration functions. 

The continued rapid onset of technology is another area creating both disruption and opportunity.

We are currently streamlining our business around the world by digitising our internal processes in HR, sales pipeline, finance, procurement, research, and communication, increasing mobility and making us more agile than ever before. 

In addition we intend to increase investment and deliver better returns on the already significant innovation happening across the business and are in the process of recruiting a Group Director of Innovation and Technology to drive this.

As an example we are accelerating the implementation of Building Information Modelling, or BIM. We added BIM level 2 accreditation to our operations in the United Kingdom and will be rolling this out progressively around the globe, positioning ourselves well ahead of our competitors.

Building on our strength in Asset Management we have more ISO 55001 Certified Asset Management Assessors than any other single organisation in the world, so clients can always trust our methods, competency and practice.

As the strategy starts to bed in, and the benefits of the improvement initiatives take hold, early trends are positive and encouraging as can be seen in the graphs here.

Gross Margin has improved in the first quarter of 2017 and is ahead of the same comparable period over the last four years.

We are also seeing improvement in Net revenue per FTE especially marked in the first quarter of 2017 driven by both consolidation of FTEs and relative Net revenue increases. 
 
In addition, the key measure of labour productivity is also showing positive improvement. 

The benefits of our new strategy were highlighted last year when New Zealand experienced the biggest and most complex earthquake since 1855, in Kaikoura. 

The level of damage to the road and rail networks between Picton and Christchurch was unprecedented and is one of the most demanding infrastructure projects ever seen in New Zealand, costing the economy over $10m per day.

Our global teams were rapidly mobilised immediately after the initial quake to support our main client the NZ Transport Agency to get Kaikoura back on its feet with over 100 people involved in the rebuild and repair work from around the world.

In addition, we have a lead role in the North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery panel, an alliance tasked with the major repair works around Kaikoura and currently have around 50 people seconded in the team.  

Events like the Kaikoura earthquake reinforce why a stringent Health, Safety and wellness culture is so critical. Our people must be just as safe working in any part of the globe as they are at home. We’ve built a global team which is bringing us greater consistency, visibility of our risks and accountability for improvement.

In 2016 we continued to drive initiatives to reinforce and promote a positive safety culture throughout the organisation. One of the major changes in April 2016, was the enactment of the new health and safety at work Act in New Zealand. Having implemented a comprehensive e-learning programme for all employees and aligning our processes and practices prior to the act coming in, transition was seamless. 

Taking a lead indicator like Safe Behaviour observations, these improved by 13% in the second half of 2016 and as I said earlier, our global lost time incidents went down by 30% from the previous year, which is a very positive result.

Industry awards are also important to us because they help attract and retain top talent and increase our profile as a leading global infrastructure company.

Last year our people and projects won more than 60 industry awards and the current slide shows a selection of our successes.
 
Ultimately as I said earlier though, while the result in 2016 was not what we wanted, even in a challenging year we continued to win awards, celebrate our people and drive the business forward with our new strategy.

As we celebrate our 20th anniversary as Opus International Consultants, we are continuing our proud 140 year legacy of making a difference. Moving from the Public Works Department to a publically listed business, our ability to adapt to change is what defines us. Our purpose is creating what matters for future generations and I am very proud of the work our people continue to do for so many communities and clients around the world. 

Thank you for listening this morning. I look forward to your questions and talking with you after.

  Opus Annual Meeting 11 April 2017 

NEW ZEALAND THE BRIGHT SPOT FOR OPUS 

Opus International Consultants (NZX:OIC) is seeing the benefits of its new global growth strategy, following a disappointing 2016.

Addressing Opus’ AGM in Wellington today, Opus Chairman Kerry McDonald said “early indicators show the new global growth strategy is helping Opus overcome challenging market conditions. The transformation, led by CEO Dr David Prentice, is going well and is very positive for Opus.”

Dr Prentice said that a much improved 2016 second-half performance has continued into 2017.

“While overall Group performance in 2016 was poor, there were some real positives, particularly the performance of the New Zealand business.”

“The New Zealand business delivered an all-time record Operating EBIT of $36.9 million, and an impressive margin of 13.2%.” 

""In the United Kingdom, Opus’ recovery from the GFC continues. The business was named Company of the Year by New Civil Engineer from the top 100 global consultancies, and revenue increased by 8.4%.” 

“Opus’ North American business continues to battle difficult conditions in the oil and gas sector but downsizing delivered an improved performance, moving from a $5.1 million first half trading loss to a $2.1 million trading profit in the second half.”

“In Australia, where the economy continues a slow recovery, five offices were closed and costs reduced to align to available revenue.”

“After combining the leadership of our New Zealand and Australian operations last year we’ve appointed a new senior leader from outside the industry, Ian Blair, as Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand,” said Dr Prentice.

“With the new strategy now underway and after nine years as Chairman, it is time for me to step down from the Board,” said Chairman Kerry McDonald.

“I will be working with the Board to ensure a smooth transition to the new Chairperson, and am confident about the company’s outlook.”

    Orion Health FY2017 Update 
    9:30am,  3 Apr 2017 | FORECAST
  

  3 April 2017

Orion Health FY2017 Update

Orion Health has this morning provided an update on revenue, earnings and cash for the FY2017 financial year. The Company remains committed to reaching profitability during FY2018. The update is as follows:

• A number of contracts that were expected to close before the end of FY2017 did not do so but remain in progress.  Forecast FY2017 Operating Revenue is now between $194 million and $200 million. Although FY2017 revenue is now forecast to be a decrease on FY2016 in GAAP terms, we still expect to see year on year revenue growth in constant currency terms, albeit modest.

• The full year Net Loss before Income Tax is expected to be between $32 million and $38 million, an improvement of approximately $20 million from FY2016. The Company has carefully managed costs to ensure the impact on the bottom line is minimised. The ongoing management of costs allows Orion Health to continue to target a move into profitability during FY2018.

• The closing cash position is now expected to be $2 million to $6 million.

The Company is undertaking a strategic review that focuses on maximising shareholder value.  As part of this process the Company has been in discussions with a number of parties over the past quarter that may result in a partnership or minority investment in the Company.  These discussions are preliminary and non-conclusive at this stage.  Orion Health will update investors of any material developments.

CEO Ian McCrae says, “as the majority shareholder I am directly aligned with all shareholders and this is not the outturn we had targeted. We have been taking, and continue to take, direct measures to right size our costs with our revenue growth and despite the slippage, we remain on track with our profitability objective.  The Board and I remain focused on long term shareholder value and will evaluate the merits of any partnerships or minority investments to help Orion Health achieve its potential.”

Questions and Answers

Why is revenue lower than we expected until recently?

Management takes full responsibility for not executing as efficiently on the sales pipeline as had been forecast.  The Company’s pipeline remains strong but as contract values move into higher dollar brackets we are finding contracting periods have extended. The delay in the finalisation of contracts is not attributable to a specific factor as every potential customer situation is unique. Improved sales processes and forecasting are core areas of focus. 

Despite the disappointing performance in FY2017, the Company has continued to make progress across all regions including the recent signing of a US based network of more than 1,000 independent health care providers and a UK based integrated electronic health and social care record solution to cover a population of over 750,000 people.

Is it a timing only issue, or have you lost customers?

The lower revenue is not due to the loss of customers. A number of the opportunites are still in progress and if finalised will contribute to FY2018. 

How will this impact the FY2018 outlook?

The Company has previously provided guidance to the market that it expects to reach break even during FY2018. This guidance remains unchanged. 

The Company will issue further FY2018 guidance at the appropriate time. 

How has the Company managed costs?

Management has been working to improve margins throughout the business. Going forward, we expect to see an improved contribution from the regions as a result of improving margins. The Company will continue to manage and in certain areas reduce costs in a manner that adequately reflects its financial profile and outlook. 

What implications does this have for your R&amp;D programme?

The Company will continue to run the appropriate R&amp;D programme to ensure we are producing innovative and market leading products.  The business case supporting our R&amp;D programme focuses on better market positioning and leveraging our large install base.  The Company remains confident that its R&amp;D programme has a payoff that merits the investment.

Is the debt facility still available?

Our working capital facilities remain in place with ASB Bank who remain committed to Orion Health. 

What parties are you talking to as part of the additional investors?

Current discussions with additional investors are confidential. We will update the market at the appropriate time. 

What form will the investment take?

The Company has a number of options available that it will continue to evaluate.

    NZX Board appoints Mark Peterson as CEO
    8:30am, 10 Apr 2017 | OFFICE
  

  The NZX Board has today announced the appointment of Mark Peterson as its new CEO, effective immediately. 

Mark has held the role of Acting CEO since January 2017. He has been permanently appointed to the position following a comprehensive global search undertaken by the Board, through which it determined that Mark was the ideal candidate to lead the business. 

Announcing the appointment, NZX Chairman James Miller says Mark has more than 25 years’ experience in the financial services sector covering capital markets, share broking, private wealth, and institutional and retail banking. He will bring to the CEO role a continued focus on strengthening NZX’s relationships with its key stakeholders, while strategically growing the business to ensure it is best placed to compete domestically and internationally. 

“Mark has shown himself to be a highly capable leader during his time at NZX and more recently as Acting CEO. In addition to his extensive markets experience, Mark has been instrumental in transforming staff engagement, with his clear communication skills and collaborative leadership style. He has also led the successful development of NZX’s Wealth Technologies business and has a proven track record of sound commercial judgement.”  

“The Board is extremely pleased to make this appointment and we look forward to working alongside Mark and the wider NZX team.”

NZX CEO Mark Peterson commented: “It is a privilege to lead NZX, an organisation which plays a pivotal role in supporting New Zealand’s capital markets. I welcome this opportunity to keep growing our markets, and I am committed to building a very collaborative team at the centre of this network, which engages, seeks feedback, and in turn delivers greater value for our customers and shareholders.” 

The Board was committed to finding the best possible candidate to lead NZX. To ensure the successful candidate had the right experience and skills to grow NZX, the Board commissioned governance services firm Propero Consulting to survey a wide sample of its stakeholders including shareholders, staff and market participants to ensure a broad perspective on the characteristics and values needed for this role.

Feedback from the survey consistently emphasised that the most important characteristics included having a passion for financial markets, a reputation for creating strong stakeholder relationships, extensive markets knowledge, and a sound understanding of technology. 

The ability to create wealth, seasoned judgement, financial acumen, and generate a simplified strategic vision for NZX to ensure value creation for shareholders in the future were also key characteristics. Mark has demonstrated these skills.

    NZX joins UN Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative
    9:00am, 18 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX today announced that it has joined the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange (SSE) initiative as a partner exchange. 

The SSE initiative provides a platform for exchanges to discuss environmental, social and corporate governance enhancements and stimulate discussions about sustainable investment.

Joining more than 60 global exchanges this partnership reinforces NZX’s ongoing commitment to promote more sustainable and transparent capital markets here in New Zealand, and improved environmental, social and corporate governance disclosure by listed issuers to ensure increased transparency for investors. 

In addition, this partnership reinforces the work currently being undertaken by NZX to update its Corporate Governance Code (Code), which will be released shortly. This will be the first substantive update to the Code since 2003 and represents a significant step forward in reducing fragmentation between various governance reporting requirements and guidance for NZX Main Board listed issuers.

NZX CEO Mark Peterson commented: “NZX is delighted to join the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative. Given the role NZX plays at the centre of New Zealand’s capital markets we have a unique opportunity to work with listed companies to encourage and enhance the quality of environmental, social and corporate governance reporting.”

“We are looking forward to collaborating with other partner exchanges and passing our learnings onto NZX listed issuers.”

As part of this initiative, NZX will also join United Nations discussions on Green Finance, which will investigate how stock exchanges can work with regulators, policy makers, listed companies and investors to better support the transition to greener and more inclusive economies.

The SSE is organised by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN Global Compact, the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).

UNCTAD Director of Investment and Enterprise James Zhan commented: ""We welcome the New Zealand stock exchange to the United Nation’s global family of stock exchanges, working with us to promote responsible investment in sustainable development.” 

PRI Managing Director Fiona Reynolds commented: “The PRI is delighted to welcome NZX as a partner exchange to the SSE initiative. We believe exchanges provide an important nexus point for bringing together investors, companies, policymakers and civil society to create a truly sustainable financial system.”

    AGM-Additional information re: Shareholder Resolution 
    12:06pm, 13 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  The New Zealand Refining Company Limited (Refining NZ) – 2017 Annual Meeting: 
Additional information regarding Shareholder’s Motion by Mr Halliwell

The Company provides the following further information in relation to a shareholder motion proposed by Mr Brian Halliwell, which appears as agenda item 3(a) in the Notice of Meeting.

Mr Halliwell has written to the Company to acknowledge that certain assertions made in his statement in support of his motion, which appears in the Notice of Meeting, are inaccurate and must be disregarded.  Specifically, Mr Halliwell acknowledges that the figures in his table under the heading “These low value exports increased from $NZ55 million, in 2005, to $NZ255 million, in 2011” are inaccurate.  Mr Halliwell acknowledges that the Company alerted him to these inaccuracies before he finalised his motion and supporting statement and he has apologised to the Company for his failure to correct them.

The Independent Directors’ response to Mr Halliwell’s motion, which appears in the Notice of Meeting, records that Mr Halliwell’s assertion that the refinery’s customers exported 28.5 million barrels of product with a Gross Refining Margin (GRM) impact of hundreds of millions of dollars is not correct and that in fact only 4.8 million barrels of product were exported with a positive effect on the overall GRM.

Notwithstanding his acknowledgement that his figures are wrong, Mr Halliwell has informed the Company that he nevertheless wishes that his motion is put to shareholders. 

The Company’s Independent Directors recommend that shareholders vote against Mr Halliwell’s motion.

Company Secretary

    Sanford Limited Annual Meeting - Chairman's Address
    2:00pm, 14 Dec 2016 | ADDRESS
  

  14 December 2016

Sanford Limited 2016 Annual Meeting 
Mr Paul Norling
Chairman’s Address 

The Directors of Sanford are pleased to present to shareholders our report for the year ended 30 September, 2016. A full account of the company’s progress and the Board’s work over this past year is provided in the Annual Report, but it is appropriate that I highlight and summarize the Board’s main areas of focus over this past financial year.

Following that I would like to elaborate a little more about the strategic journey the company is now on and touch on some other matters that are relevant.

My address to you will be followed by a more in-depth review of operational and other important matters from our Chief Executive Officer, Volker Kuntzsch.

(Slide 1) 

REVIEW OF THE 2016 FINANCIAL YEAR

The year was again – undoubtedly – a very busy one, for both our management team as well as the Board.

(Slide 2) 

I will start with a summary of our financial results.

Net profit after tax increased substantially this year to $34.7m – an increase of 152% over the 2015 year.  2015, admittedly, was a poor bottom line year as we absorbed restructuring and impairment charges totalling $16.3m. Our 2016 year result, however, was also after further impairment and restructuring costs totalling $5.6m. These additional costs, in the main, being a consequence of a further vessel write-down that we had to take to complete our exit from the pacific tuna fishery.  As we have said previously, this fishery was both unprofitable and, in our view, very problematic in respect to its sustainability. We are therefore pleased to say we are now completely out of that fishery!

(Slide 3) 

To provide a broader and perhaps better balanced perspective on this profit of $34.7m, I am also going to compare it with the average of our bottom line results over the previous five year period. This shows that our average net profit after tax commencing with the 2011 year, was $19.7m.  On this comparative basis our 2016 result was an increase of 76% over the average of those past 5 years and resulted in earnings per share of 37.1 cents, which is the best earnings per share result for the company since 2009.

We are therefore – on your behalf – obviously pleased with the result.  This, however, is a ‘journey’ that management and your Board are on to fulfil the profitability potential of your company and this will take time – it certainly isn’t able to be achieved overnight.  While we are not complacent regarding the challenges we have ahead of us, the Board is also confident that the management team along with the strategy that your Board has approved, will  deliver further worthwhile increases in our future profitability albeit not of the same annual percentage that we have managed for this year.

The other feature of the company’s 2016 result that I wish to comment on is that mainly as a consequence of our exiting the Pacific tuna fishery, and also electing to limit catching of pelagic species in our New Zealand waters to match the reduced market demand for these commodity species, management was able to deliver this profit result from a total sales volume that was 10,000 tonnes (some 11%) less than last year, which added to the quality of the result.  

Having covered that somewhat briefly I will now leave a good deal of the detail regarding our past year’s activities to our Chief Executive Officer so that I can canvas other matters of interest for you.

(Slide 4)

DIVIDEND

Firstly, let me speak briefly about the dividend. You will have noted from the Annual Report that in spite of what was a pleasing result, the Directors decided not to increase your dividend. We are certainly conscious of your patience in this regard and I will endeavour to explain to you the Board’s reasoning.

Firstly, the seafood business is a capital intensive one both in respect to our fishing fleet as well as our shore-based processing operations. Our fleet does require on-going capital expenditure for both refurbishment and renewal reasons.  This, coupled with what can be the unpredictable nature of the business, means that it is important we operate the business conservatively from a financing viewpoint.

Overlaying this, was the acquisition of the San Granit which is the largest and most expensive fishing vessel the company has purchased – I am told in its entire and very considerable history. As a consequence we now need to focus on getting our borrowings back to a more prudent level in the short term and management has some objectives to achieve in this respect by the end of the 2017 financial year. I will return briefly to the San Granit shortly.

A further  element  I wish to mention is that even with the pleasing profit that has just been achieved, our dividend cover at the existing dividend rate of 23 cents per share, is only covered 1.6 times which is somewhat marginal,  in our opinion, for a capital intensive business of this type.  This dividend matter, in part, has also been a consequence of the Board refraining from reducing the dividend during years when our profitability was not where we may have wished it to be. 

Perhaps one final observation on this subject might also be that even with our strengthening share price, the dividend yield may not look that unattractive given the current low interest rate environment. 

(Slide 5) 

SAN GRANIT

Now to briefly return to the San Granit - this was a substantial investment for the company which the Board, only after detailed scrutiny and full consideration, agreed to approve (in September of last year) management’s strong recommendation to purchase.

Moving to mid-November of this year, the San Granit – as planned -  completed her delivery voyage from the furthest reaches of the northern hemisphere to her new home port of Timaru.  Since then she has been undergoing preparations to commence her fishing career at Sanford and it is planned that she will depart Timaru tomorrow for a ‘shake-down’ voyage of approximately 10 days.  Immediately following her return she will depart on her inaugural full fishing voyage for Sanford returning to Timaru around the end of January.  Her approximate length of voyage will generally be in the region of 5-6 weeks (with full rotational crews which each number approximately 38 people but she can accommodate up to 48) and her fishing grounds will predominantly be the Southern oceans. 

On this subject I would like to finally mention that on 25 November, I had the privilege, on behalf of the Board, to attend the blessing ceremony for the vessel in Timaru.  I therefore had the opportunity of having a detailed look over the entire ship and its capabilities and it was readily apparent that she is a fine vessel which will serve us well over many years to come. In the short (and longer) term she can materially assist our objective of adding value through the superior sales returns we will be able to gain from her catch. This will be achieved by utilising her substantial and efficient factory capacity to produce the likes of frozen at sea fillet products.  A further benefit will be the reduction in costs per kg of greenweight catch she will also achieve for us.

 
(Slide 6)

STRATEGY

I now wish to add some comments regarding strategy which we spoke of at last year’s meeting and have done so quite extensively in our Annual Report.
There are a couple of matters I wish to underline for you again.

Firstly, that our main focus is on product quality and adding value. Our intent is that we add as much real value as we possibly and profitably can to our resource here in New Zealand before presenting it to our customers both in New Zealand and overseas. Often this will mean we do less with it rather than more i.e. sell as much of it as we can in a pristine fresh form as that is what our customers want. There are obviously limitations to the extent to which we can sell our beautiful seafood resource in a pristine fresh form and while we have already made some pleasing progress in this direction, management is confident that there is still significant scope to achieve increasing levels.  As already mentioned, frozen at sea fillets is also another avenue which adds to product quality and the value we obtain.

The second issue is regarding innovation, which is also a key growth strategy for us.

Over the past 4 - 5 years we have been investing in targeted major innovation projects and at the same time developing our own ‘in-house’ innovation and research and development capabilities.

The ‘flagship’ R &amp; D  projects,  with which we are both practically and very financially  involved, are  the SPATnz project in Nelson - this has a development budget of $26m funded equally by the Ministry for Primary Industries (under the primary growth partnership scheme) and ourselves. The second ‘flagship’ is the Precision Seafood Harvesting project (this is developing the new and revolutionary fish netting system which we have spoken of previously) and this has a $52m development budget. This again is half funded by the government via the PGP scheme, with the other 50% being shared by three private sector major fishing companies of which Sanford is one. 

These two projects have a collective cost to Sanford of approximately $20m but they both hold considerable promise for your company for the future as we seek to take both our fishing activities and aquaculture mussel business to another significant level in value creation. These projects while still in their development stage, have made considerable advancements   with fish caught using the new net prototype being potentially available for sale under the ‘Tiaki’ brand during the first half of 2017. Spat from the SPATnz hatchery has also now been successfully settled on our ropes in the Marlborough Sounds with harvesting of the first hatchery based crop, due in late 2017.

More extensive detail on these two major projects can be found in our Annual Report and we will also continue to keep you informed of their progress.

Regarding our own ‘in-house’ R &amp; D capability we are now at a point where we are beginning to bring selected projects and products forward for commercialisation. As we grow our experience and capability in this key forward looking area, we are expecting an increasing flow of new opportunities leading to financial enhancement of our business. The Board is keenly interested in these developments and keeps a regular oversight of this potentially very rewarding - but currently developing - area of our company’s capability.

(Slide 7)

The point I am endeavouring to emphasize here is to underline the investment cost that the company is incurring on an annual basis as an investment for the future - to enable additional pathways to progressively increase our profitability in the years ahead.  As we have stated in the past, the world’s wildcatch resource is finite (i.e. it is not going to increase) so we must ensure  that for you (our shareholders) as well as for New Zealand as a whole, the imperative for us is to maximise the return we make for every kg of greenweight catch we land.

Our forward thinking generally, also includes aquaculture which now accounts for approximately 50% of total global seafood consumed annually by the world’s population.

We have an important footprint with greenshell mussels which our SPATnz investment should further enhance. We have, however, a substantial number of our mussel farm marine leases coming up for renewal  around 2024 (as does most of the industry) and it would be desirable for the government to take all steps possible to expedite and conclude that process just as soon as possible. Government is aware of this and are sympathetic and supportive of the industry’s objectives.

In respect to our Big Glory Bay salmon, this is an absolutely standout product in all respects and we cannot satisfy the market demand we have for it. While this might sound like a nice problem to have we would greatly benefit from additional water space close to our existing Stewart Island farming facility to meet the present market demand. This is a great opportunity for regional development (and jobs growth that would go with it) and the Southland community is very supportive of this initiative. Unfortunately, the wheels for this type of development do seem to turn slowly but the company’s management is doing everything they can to move this along as promptly and effectively as possible.

 
(Slide 8) 

SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY - THE FISHING INDUSTRY’S PROFILE.

You will be aware of the media attention that has been focussed on the fishing industry since the release of a report in May of this year which was funded by overseas interests. The report sought to cast a shadow over the industry by claiming that during a period of 60 years from 1950, New Zealand commercial fishing had substantially under-reported the actual catch of fish. The report was based largely on selective and anecdotal claims which cannot and were not substantiated.

The report also sought to question the methodology and veracity of the New Zealand quota management system (established in 1986,) and the Ministry for Primary Industries in respect to its oversight responsibilities. As we have stated in our Annual Report, there are certain matters that could and should be tidied up and we are keen for that to happen – but by and large the QMS approach has served the sustainability of our fish stocks extremely well and New Zealand is regarded as a global leader in this field. Associated with this report, certain environmental related issues were also raised.

Because we view this as an extremely important matter, the Board and management have discussed it at considerable length and depth and our views on the subject are fully aligned.  Sustainability of the health of our oceans and our fish stocks is at the core of the industry’s own future prospects and that is why the industry takes the matter so seriously and will play its part in preserving the integrity and sustainability of our oceans for all the future generations to come.

From solely a Sanford perspective, our ethical standards and reputation are extremely important to us – both in respect to our long history as well as the provenance of our products today and going forward. We have very high standards required of all our catching, farming and processing operations and these are subject to diligent and close continuing oversight by our senior management team. 

I would remind you that two of our three absolute core values are: care and integrity!  We know this and I assure you that we will continue to walk the talk.

Reflecting the importance of sustainability, Sanford has therefore also taken an industry – and probably Australasian - leadership position in respect to transparency with our annual reporting. This has led to the international acclaim that has been accorded the company for its Annual Report which incorporates extensive transparency on practically all sustainability issues. This report takes a vast amount of work to produce, and while it no doubt can be progressively improved even further, we are proud of this transparent view of the company and all our activities, and we trust our shareholders find it of value and interest as well. Might I add that our current Annual Report just released in printed form within the last 2 weeks is also already drawing highly favourable comment from informed parties on the quality and extent of the information we provide.

OTHER MATTERS

• Kaikoura Earthquake
I thought you may be interested to have a brief comment regarding the Kaikoura earthquake and any consequences the company may have suffered.

As you are aware we have a substantial portion of our greenshell mussel business located in the Marlborough Sounds.  The farms all appear to have come through unscathed but our processing facility located at Havelock needed to be closed for 2 weeks following the quake to enable a preliminary assessment of damage to be made by engineers and our insurance assessors. We re-opened the plant on Monday, 28 November and it immediately swung into full production even though there was some damage to the facility which is located on reclaimed land. We are yet to have the final assessment from our engineers and insurance people but we have been assured of its structural safety and integrity as far as our people working there are concerned.

• Health and Safety
I would like to up-date you in an overall sense regarding the subject of health and safety throughout the company.  At our Annual Meeting last year I commented on the steps that management and the Board continue to take to endeavour to ensure, we, as an entity and as individuals, are as good as we can possibly be in respect to the very important responsibility of the safety and well-being of our people. To give effect to this, the company commits substantial expenditure every year, as well as extensive people resources and time, from the Board down.

Going back to 2015, we had – for reasons we found difficult to pinpoint – a disappointing year in respect to the incidence of serious harm injuries across our entire staff which totals approximately 1,500 people.  In 2014 we had just 6 serious harm injuries but this number doubled to 12 in 2015. This caused us to redouble and refocus our efforts with the objective of substantially reducing this number over this past year. I am therefore very pleased to report to you that the company was able to achieve this goal by halving the number back to 6, which was a particularly satisfying result.  The challenge now is to endeavour to ensure that we are able to maintain this standard and then progressively improve it until we achieve our objective of having zero serious harm injuries.

We also managed to achieve a 30% reduction in the number of lost days resulting from lost time injuries which indicates a meaningful lessening in the severity of such injuries to our people.

(Slide 10) 

• Board Committee Structure 
Last year I informed you of our intention to expand the number and involvement of Board working committees from the beginning of this year, with the objective being to improve the analysis and consideration of proposals coming forward from management.  An added objective was to also free up Board meeting time to assess and discuss substantial strategic and commercial matters relating to important areas of the company.

This has resulted in the number of committee meetings increasing by around 50% from that previously, and a much wider range of matters being addressed or assessed in greater depth than what otherwise might have been the case.

(Slide 11)

• Overseas Ownership 
You will have seen from your Notice of Meeting that the Board wishes to tighten our ability to be able to more effectively manage the possibility that overseas ownership of our company could well exceed 25% at some stage.  If this was to occur and we did not have an effective means to deal with it, we would be at risk of losing our entire wildcatch fishing quota, which is the major asset of the company. Such a prospect is obviously untenable. 

With our overseas ownership now at 17.5% and increasing, we have taken advice on the matter and formulated a protective process to follow should that situation arise. It is apparent that the improving performance of your company and the strategy it is now following, is of increasing interest to international entities either allied to the seafood industry or investment vehicles looking more actively for strategic positions in key food areas such as seafood.  It is therefore imperative that we address this matter now and take the steps that need to be taken to protect your investment in Sanford from this catastrophic type of risk.

I will not go further on this topic at this point as it will be dealt with again in considering Resolution 4.

 
(Slide 12)

CONCLUSION
We are already nearing the end of the first quarter of the 2017 financial year – and there is no respite!

We do have, however, a very motivated and hardworking senior executive team which lead the company and are supported by a capable and focussed head office management group that has been further expanded over the past year to better resource the company’s new direction and purpose.

Right across the company we then have our operational management structure and extensive  staff located at sea (throughout New Zealand’s 4.4 million square kilometre Exclusive Economic Zone as well as the deep Southern Oceans) and on land at our processing and farming locations in Stewart Island, Bluff,  Timaru,  Havelock, Tauranga,  Coromandel  and  Auckland as well as in Australia. This team are all working very hard and doing their very best to play their role in helping Sanford become “the best seafood company in the world”. The organisation in its totality and with its ambitious vision, is all under the very able and inspirational leadership of our CEO, Volker Kuntzsch.

The Board’s thanks go to Volker and his entire team for a job well done over this past year and with it also goes our encouragement and support for an even better year in 2017.

Thank you ladies and gentlemen – I will now pass the microphone to Volker to present his Chief Executive Officer’s report to shareholders.

  14 November 2016 
NZX Announcement 

Update to the Market 

For the first six months of the financial year to October 2016, Smiths City Group (SCY) is pleased to announce increased revenues of 17.6%, when compared to the same period last year, due in part to the purchase of Furniture City in April 2016. On a same store basis, sales revenues increased by 7.7%. Delivered gross margin improved by 1% over last year for the same period. 

The retail division of Smiths City Group, Smiths City Southern, has entered into a lease which will see the opening of the 30th Smiths City store in Hastings, New Zealand. When opened in February, 2017, this store will be the first of the Group’s new store retail layouts based on the market research conducted in 2016, and is consistent with the Group’s stated desire to expand nationally. The retail layout will be then rolled out throughout the retail presence as per the CEO’s address to shareholders in September, 2016. 

Smiths City Group Limited also advises that it has signed a committed terms sheet (Term Sheet) with a major trading bank to refinance the existing financial indebtedness of SCY and its wholly owned subsidiary, Smiths City Finance Limited. 

The Term Sheet is subject to final legal documentation and customary conditions precedent being satisfied. The Group will be required to provide guarantees and security to the bank. 

The Board of SCY believes that the new debt facilities will result in material savings in interest costs to the group. 

Contemporaneously with this announcement SCY will notify its current financier of its intention to terminate the Group’s existing debt facilities in accordance with the terms of each facility agreement. 

The new facilities are expected to become available to the Group on or around March 2017.

    Skellerup HY17 Results
    8:51am, 16 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  16 February 2017

Skellerup reaffirms FY17 Guidance and maintains interim dividend

Key points for the six months ending 31 December 2016
- Revenue of $97 million down 10% (in constant currency terms down 2%) and EBIT down 3% on prior corresponding period (pcp). Stronger NZD key driver of revenue reduction with earnings impact partially negated by underlying business improvements and hedging gains. 
- NPAT of $8.9 million down 7% on pcp. Finance costs $430k up as expected on increased debt associated with the recently completed integrated Dairy Rubberware facility at Wigram.
- Interim Dividend maintained at 3.5 cents (fully imputed) per share.
- FY17 NPAT guidance unchanged and expected to be in a range of $20 to $22 million.
- New Wigram facility operating well and in line with expectations.

Solid underlying performance for most businesses and lower indirect costs helped negate much of the impact of the stronger NZD on Skellerup earnings for the six months to 31 December 2016. Lower sales into the Australian mining industry and the expected increase in finance costs were the primary cause of the reduction in NPAT. 
 
Agri Division revenue was down 11% but EBIT was up 1% on pcp.  CEO David Mair said that the reduction in revenue was due to lower dairy rubberware sales into the European market and NZD strength against all currencies.

“The European market remains soft with lower demand exacerbated by the weaker GBP &amp; Euro. However, our overall earnings held to prior year levels due to a strong contribution from the US market, solid demand in NZ and Australia and FX hedging gains. We are cautiously optimistic that the recent improvement in the international milk price will continue to underpin solid demand in the second half of the year for our products, many of which are essential consumables, important for milk quality and animal health.” 

Mr Mair also noted that Skellerup’s new integrated Dairy Rubberware Development and Manufacturing facility at Wigram was performing well, with all Agri activities now on site.
 
Industrial Division revenue was down 9% and EBIT down 6% on pcp. Mr Mair said the reduction in revenue was primarily due to lower sales into the Australian mining sector and NZD strength against all currencies. 

“We have continued to improve our Industrial businesses, however lower sales into the West Australian mining sector more than offset the gains made in the first half of the year. We expect an improved contribution from the Industrial Division in the second half.” 

Chair Liz Coutts said Skellerup’s results and financial position represented a solid performance and robust position and noted the Board and management are focussed on earnings growth.

“With the new Wigram facility complete, our focus is firmly on products and systems for food safety, potable and waste water applications. These continue to provide a resilient business platform for Skellerup. We are working hard to further translate this into stronger earnings growth.”

Skellerup’s Balance Sheet remains strong. With construction of the new Wigram facility complete, net debt was $35.6 million at 31 December 2016, representing just 23% of equity. 
The Board resolved to maintain the interim dividend, declaring a 3.5 cps pay-out, fully imputed. This will be paid out on 23 March 2017 to shareholders on the register at 5.00pm on 10 March 2017.

Mrs Coutts reaffirmed Skellerup expected FY17 net profit after tax to be in the range of $20 to $22 million.

  Serko Strengthens Executive Bench With International Talent

Serko Limited (SKO) today announced the appointment of Charlie Nowaczek in the role of Chief Operating Officer.  This new appointment brings international experience to Serko and signals a renewed focus on operational efficiencies. 

Charlie Nowaczek will report directly to the CEO, Darrin Grafton, and enters the COO role with more than 25 years’ experience as both an operating executive and management consultant, specialising in business transformation and operational effectiveness. 

Over the last decade he has been COO for a number of technology start-ups in the US and Canada, including most recently, Kinetic Social, a social data and technology platform partnered with Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where he was part of the founding team. Prior to these entrepreneurial endeavours, he was a senior consultant focused on the delivery of complex business change programmes for US and European clients.   

Serko CEO Darrin Grafton said, “We welcome Charlie, who brings a real depth of operational and international experience, and is a great fit with Serko’s down-to-earth culture. We operate in an increasingly dynamic market so it is important to attract senior executives with diverse market experience and a record of accomplishment in thinking flexibly and acting swiftly.”

Other changes will see Chief Product Officer, Tim Nichols, depart the business to pursue other opportunities on 24 February, and Joanne Phipps, who has been managing Serko’s product portfolio for over 18 years, become acting Head of Product.

    Spark’s offer to acquire TeamTalk has now lapsed

  Spark New Zealand has noted the shareholder vote at today’s TeamTalk special shareholder meeting to approve the sale of a 70% shareholding in Farmside. As previously advised, Spark New Zealand will not waive the remaining conditions of its offer to acquire TeamTalk, thus its offer to acquire 100% of the shares in TeamTalk has now lapsed, and shareholders are no longer able to accept Spark’s offer.

    Spark NZ outlines upgrade of NZ's voice communications
    9:59am, 19 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Media Release 

19 April 2017

Spark NZ outlines upgrade of New Zealand’s voice communications 

Voice communications in New Zealand is in for a massive upgrade with Spark New Zealand announcing this morning it is switching from the ageing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to a next generation IP-based network. 

The new network, to be progressively phased in over the next five years, will provide the foundation for Spark’s voice services into the future and will bring together all voice communications – be it landline, mobile, video or data-based. 

It will enable richer, better customer experiences with voice, video, and collaboration features over whatever Spark service is available to them at the time, and provides the platform for new voice products and services into the future. 

“This is a significant and essential upgrade of our oldest network, providing us with a future-proof platform for the latest voice technology, and allowing us to develop and deploy new services. We’ve been talking about doing this for over a decade now, and many other countries are also in the process of retiring their PSTNs, so it’s great to finally be able to get on with it here,” says Spark’s Chief Operating Officer, Mark Beder.
 
“The PSTN has served New Zealanders extremely well for many decades, but it’s now nearing end of life and the clock is ticking. Its last big upgrade, to a digital switching platform, was over 30 years ago. Maintaining the network is becoming harder and harder – components are no longer manufactured, we’ve bought every second-hand part we can source from around the world, and people with the skills to maintain the technology are harder to find.

“Increasingly, customers are choosing alternatives to the old copper-based PSTN as their use of digital voice applications increase. Already, around 50% of New Zealand homes and businesses are using other technologies like Voice over Fibre, Voice over Wireless, using their mobile for voice communications or relying on messaging applications. It’s time to make the switch.”  

Beder says although the upgrade is a massive technical and logistical undertaking, it will be largely invisible to customers with minimal disruption to services. The vast majority of customers won’t need to do anything and their existing phones and devices will continue to work normally when they switch over from the PSTN to the new IP-based network, which Spark is dubbing the “Converged Communications Network” (CCN).

Spark has already been successfully trialling the transition by consolidating and decommissioning 10 of the smaller, more remote exchanges – out of the 482 PSTN exchanges scattered around the country. Another four exchanges will be decommissioned shortly.

Beder says “These trials have been very successful. All the changes take place behind the scenes and disruption to customers has been minimal. The migration entails a small outage of a few minutes, scheduled during off-peak times for residential customers.”

Most customer devices being used today will be compatible with the CCN, but there may be some rare exceptions with legacy low-speed dial up services such as older medical and house alarms, EFTPOS terminals and PABX systems. Newer IP-based digital products with more and better functionality can replace these services and Spark will be working with vendors and customers to help make the transition as easy as possible for customers as the upgrade rolls out in coming years. 

Please see attached deck for further detail.

    Synlait Appoints General Manager of Sales
    12:48pm,  4 Apr 2017 | OFFICE
  

  Synlait (NZX: SML; ASX: SM1) Callam Weetman has joined Synlait Milk’s Senior Leadership Team as General Manager of Sales. 

A dairy industry executive with more than 25 years of international B2B sales, business development and product category management experience, Mr Weetman will begin in late April.

As a member of the Senior Leadership Team, Callam will report to Martijn Jager, Synlait’s Director for Business Development and Sales. 

“Callam has a strong international background in the industry and has a lot to offer our team,” says John Penno, Managing Director and CEO. 

“His focus on building close partnerships with customers is a core element of our strategy to make the most from milk, so he’s already aligned with our approach.”

Mr Weetman began his dairy career with the New Zealand Dairy Board in 1993 (which merged into Fonterra in 2001) and progressed through a range of leadership roles focused on sales and business development, including as their General Manager of Global Ingredients Sales for the Middle East and Africa.
 
Most recently, Mr Weetman was the Regional Director Middle East and Africa for the Global Dairy Network and prior to that he was an Executive Director in the same region for US-based dairy company Burt Lewis. 

“We’ve built a high specification plant and have demonstrated our ability to pursue the highest returning opportunities with our partners. As we continue to focus on this, Callam will have a key role to play and he will add to the vast industry and international experience we already have in our Senior Leadership Team,” said Mr Penno.

    SLI survey finds online retailer confidence strong globally

  SLI Systems’ survey finds online retailer confidence strong globally

Inaugural Q1 2017 E-Commerce Performance Indicators and Confidence (EPIC) Report finds customer experience top 2017 initiative; retailers six times more focused on mobile site than app; 71% expect site conversion increases

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand – April 6, 2017 – Online retailing continues to prove its resilience with strong growth and a positive forecast for 2017.

A new e-commerce report published by SLI Systems (SLI.NZ), a global leader and provider of e-commerce solutions and services, found 94% of retail professionals surveyed expected to expand their businesses during the first quarter of 2017. When respondents were asked about expected results in Q1 2017 compared to the same quarter last year, the vast majority forecasted performance improvements across an array of areas, including online revenue, site conversion, mobile transactions and site traffic.

Respondents to the inaugural Q1 2017 E-commerce Performance Indicators and Confidence (EPIC) Report represent a mix of retail business models, including pure e-commerce and omnichannel merchants. In addition, 87% of respondents work in a manager position or above and 20% hold Vice President or Chief-level positions. The full report is available for download for no cost at http://sitesearch.sli-systems.com/Epic-Report.html.

The EPIC report includes a detailed Respondent Overview, Confidence and Performance Indicators, Top of Mind (a look at the anticipated business impact of the new U.S. presidential administration) and Search Trend Analysis (a look at trends in the number of words in site search queries).

Q1 2017 EPIC Report Highlights:
- Widespread Confidence – When asked about six areas of planned expansion in Q1, from product expansion to hiring, 94% of respondents selected at least one area of growth
- Q1 Revenues &amp; Profits – 80% of respondents expect an increase in online revenues and profits, and 46% expect an increase in their in-store revenues and profits.
- Key Performance Metrics – Comparing Q1 2017 to Q1 2016
o 71% expect increased site conversion (CVR)
o 53% expect increased average order value (AOV)
o 47% expect decreased cart abandonment rates
o 41% expect decreased bounce rates
o 76% expect either a decrease or no change in their fulfillment costs per order
- Top Q1 Initiative – Customer Experience (26%), Inventory, Logistics and Fulfillment (14%), Mobile Site (12%) and a three-way tie for fourth place (11% each): Personalization, Advertising or Paid Search, and Replatforming.
- Mobile – 73% expect an increase in mobile transactions. Among those who cited mobile as their top initiative for the quarter, the group selected “Mobile Site” six times more than “Mobile App”.
- Amazon – 32% of U.S. respondents, 38% of those in the UK, and 47% in Australia report Amazon is more of a competitive threat compared to the same quarter last year.
- Trump – U.S. retailers (generally) anticipate the new U.S. Administration will have a positive impact on corporate taxes, a negative impact on selling internationally, and no impact on online sales taxes. 23% of UK respondents expect the administration will have a somewhat or very negative impact, versus 6% citing a somewhat or very positive impact on their online businesses.

“As a global provider of cloud-based e-commerce solutions and services, SLI is in a unique position to analyse retailer confidence and online shopping trends. In addition to sharing in-depth survey responses, this inaugural EPIC Report looks at consumer behaviour from leading retail websites worldwide using our SaaS solutions,” said Chris Brubaker, SLI Systems Chief Marketing Officer.

“Our aggregate network data shows retailers are in fact delivering efficient and relevant online customer experiences, evidenced by shoppers increasingly using fewer words in site searches. This inaugural report offers a solid benchmark for us to report on and compare retailer confidence and shopping behaviour regularly.”

Methodology
The Q1 2017 EPIC Report results are from an electronic survey conducted between February 6 - March 6, 2017. SLI received qualified (non-vendor or consultant) responses from more than 200 e-commerce professionals worldwide headquartered primarily in the U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand. All respondents sell goods or services online, with 59% selling in stores, 36% via catalogues and call centres, and 42% on at least one marketplace.

    SeaDragon continues transition from Omega-2 to Omega-3
    11:00am, 18 Nov 2016 | GENERAL
  

  NZX / MEDIA RELEASE        18 November 2016

SeaDragon continues transition from Omega-2 to Omega-3

Fish oil refiner announces update for 1H 2017; sales of existing Omega-2 inventory largely complete 

New Zealand’s largest refiner and blender of high-quality fish oils SeaDragon (NZX:SEA) today announces that it will be publishing full half year results, to 30 September 2016, next week and the provisional high-level numbers are shown below:

  Unaudited Unaudited Audited 
  6 months ended 6 months ended 12 months ended
  30 September  2016 30 September  2015 31 March 2016
  $'000 $'000 $'000
    
Revenue  3,137  4,800  5,585 
Gross (loss) profit  (1,221) 1,042  (2,956)
    
Total comprehensive loss for the period (3,400) (688) (5,523)
    
Normalised EBITDA  (2,017) (146) (389)
    

The first six months of this financial year has seen SeaDragon progress its transition and business repositioning from Omega-2 to Omega-3 markets. The negative normalised EBITDA reflects the on-going impact of exiting Omega-2, including sales of Omega-2 inventories previously impaired, and the transition and start-up nature of the Omega-3 business. 

We continue to restructure our business processes to be customer led, rather than historical practices of being largely supply led.  This has meant that, at this time, we have made the decision to process smaller quantities of oil through the new Omega-3 refinery to produce samples for prospective customers and to allow us to react in an agile fashion to customer orders.  This has resulted in the fixed costs of the refineries being spread over a smaller quantity of oil, which is reflected in the financial results of the first half financial year.  

Omega-2 and Omega-3 update

SeaDragon has now largely completed sales of its existing Omega-2 inventory. We announced on 30 June this year that we had agreed to sell $2.5 million worth of existing Omega-2 inventory to a major international food and fine chemicals company – we have now fulfilled this order, having shipped and received payment for four full container loads of Omega-2 (being 64 tonnes of product in total).  We had one container (being 16 tonnes of product) remaining at the end of the financial half-year end, which has now also been shipped to this customer. 

We continue to progress discussions with major multinational companies towards securing agreements for the supply of Omega-3 and samples and specifications have been provided to several of these prospective customers. We are seeking arrangements with customers in key target markets around the globe, which requires us to meet a variety of customer and regulatory requirements. We have successfully completed audits and supply clearances by some key potential customers and regulators. As a result, our new Omega-3 refinery is capable of processing Omega-3 oil for supply to certain key target markets including Europe, the US, China, Australia and Japan.

We have also been approached by several major multinational companies to toll process oil in our new Omega-3 refinery (where the customer provides the raw material) – which, if discussions result in a contract, we expect to give us some certainty of cash flow as we continue the transition to Omega-3. 

Discussions with these key potential customers are ongoing and there is no guarantee that these discussions will lead to a contract at this stage.  

During the first half of the financial year we have sold 115 tonnes of Omega-3 tuna oil. At this time, given the uncertainty surrounding potential sales of Omega-3 and remaining Omega-2 inventories, we are not in a position to provide the market with guidance around year-end financial performance, but at this stage we expect the company to have a negative EBITDA result for FY17 with a view to working towards positive EBITDA in FY18. 

Supply update

Each of our key target markets has specific requirements for traceability through the supply chain from fishing vessels forward. We continue to identify suitable and ongoing sources of unrefined Omega-3 oil for many of these key target markets. 

Capital investment projects

The recent $10.9 million rights issue has provided us with additional capital to allow us to procure the supply of unrefined oil to be able to process and respond to customer demand rapidly once we have completed supply negotiations with key customers. As previously announced to the market, some of the rights issue proceeds will also be used to reduce the company’s external debt facilities. 

We have also initiated steps to repurpose our legacy Omega-2 refinery to become a “Boutique” refinery to refine smaller volume, specialised and premium Omega-3 products. We are currently scoping requirements to enable concentration, fractionation and re-esterification at the Boutique refinery. At this time, the expectation is to implement these capabilities at the Boutique refinery in FY18. We expect the capital investment associated with this will be approximately $2 million. In light of this, we have decided to postpone the prior proposal to add fractionation capability at the new Omega-3 refinery (expected to cost approximately $5 million).

    SeaDragon provides guidance on full year result
    10:08am,  1 Mar 2017 | FORECAST
  

  The Seadragon Board wishes to provide guidance on the company’s expected full year financial result.

We expect Normalised EBITDA for the full financial year to 31-March-17 to be in the range of a loss of (4.3)m to (4.5)m (2016: loss of (0.4m)).  

This result is a reflection of the time it has taken to transition the business from its legacy Omega-2 business to Omega-3 fish oils refined in the new refinery. The transition of the business is now substantially complete, with approximately 95% of all saleable inventory of legacy products now sold. 

To enable future sales, a key focus for the last year has been establishing on-going supply arrangements for crude tuna oil (CTO) for processing through our new refinery.  It has taken until the final quarter of this financial year to receive ongoing supply of CTO in commercially relevant quantities.  This has taken longer than originally expected and was also impacted by the seasonal nature of CTO supply, whereby we have had to wait until key supply partners have exited alternative customer contracts.

We now have a signed supply agreement for approximately 500,000 to 750,000 kg of CTO from the Indian Ocean over the next 12 months, along with agreed supply of approximately 500,000 to 1,000,000 kg from the South Pacific, South East Asia and South America.   This gives us a good mix of CTO going forward for refining for key existing and potential customers in Europe, South East Asia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.    
We have received and processed 6 containers of CTO, each weighing 22,000kg, so far in the current financial quarter.  By 31-March-17 we expect to have received, or have enroute, an additional 4 containers of CTO.  We have yet to enter into any contracts for the sale of the refined oil.  We will continue to work on increasing supply volumes during the next financial year.  We note that we do not expect to fully utilise our refineries capacity in the next financial year.  
Several of our existing and potential customers are currently evaluating samples of refined tuna oil.  Although no large volume sales contracts have been entered into yet we believe our samples meet their specifications and are hopeful we will soon receive orders.  When we have these orders confirmed we will have sufficient volume throughput whereby overhead allocation across our production facility is covered leading to a more profitable result for our shareholders. 
 
Attached to this announcement is an updated strategy overview document setting out the company’s strategic focus on Omega-3 markets going forward.

NZX Announcement        

Long Term Incentive Plan

Sanford has today extended its long term incentive plan (LTI Plan) for its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Volker Kuntzsch.
Under the ongoing LTI Plan, Mr Kuntzsch will be granted performance share rights, subject to performance hurdles to be determined by the Board from time to time.  Mr Kuntzsch must also remain employed with Sanford for three years.  
Each performance share right will give Mr Kuntzsch the right to one ordinary share in Sanford on exercise.  On exercise, no consideration is payable by Mr Kuntzsch for each share in Sanford allotted to him.  Mr Kuntzsch has agreed that following exercise of the performance share rights and for so long as he remains employed by Sanford, he will only sell a number of shares necessary to satisfy his tax obligations on exercise of the performance share rights.
The Board has determined to make a grant of 38,525 performance share rights to Mr Kuntzsch for the 2017 year.

Total Group Store Sales 497.2 387.6 +28.3%
Group Net Profit after Tax 26.0 24.1 +7.8%
Dividend (cps) 23.0 21.0 +9.5%
Note: All amounts are in NZD unless specified otherwise.

Key points

• Group Net Profit after Tax was $26.0 million (24.1 cents per share), up $1.9 million (+7.8%), on prior year. Net Profit after Tax (excluding non-trading items) was $30.6 million (28.4 cents per share), up 26.3% on prior year.

• Total Group Store Sales were $497.2 million, up $109.6 million (+28.3%) on prior year, primarily because of the contribution from the KFC business in Australia, but also assisted by continued strong growth from KFC New Zealand.

• New Zealand operations continued to perform well, delivering total sales of $400 million and a store EBITDA of $71.2 million of the $86.2 million reported for the group.

• With the settlement of the KFC Australian purchase in April 2016, Australian operations contributed sales of $97.2 million and store EBITDA of $15.0 million for the 10 month period. 

• Operating cash flows were $47.9 million, up $3.6 million; however investing cash outflows increased from $15.3 million to $79.0 million with the purchase of the Australian business.

• On 26 October 2016 the company entered into an agreement to acquire Pacific Island Restaurants  Inc (“PIR”), the sole Pizza Hut and Taco Bell operator in Hawaii and Guam with 82 stores. The acquisition is expected to deliver an additional $180 million in annual revenues. 

• A final fully imputed dividend of 13.5 cents per share will be paid on 23 June, making a full year dividend of 23.0 cents (up 9.5% on the previous year). 

Overview

Restaurant Brands has enjoyed a profitable financial year to 27 February 2017 with New Zealand operations delivering their best ever overall sales and profit performance, strong trading from the KFC Australian business under its new Restaurant Brands’ ownership and the successful completion of the acquisition of the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchise in Hawaii (although settlement was not completed until after balance date).     

Group Operating Results

Restaurant Brands Net Profit after Tax for the 52 weeks to 27 February 2017 (FY17) was $26.0 million (24.1 cents per share*), up 7.8% on last year’s profit of $24.1 million (24.6 cents per share - on a smaller share base). 

Net Profit after Tax (excluding non-trading items) was $30.6 million (28.4 cents per share*), up 26.3% on the $24.2 million (24.7 cents per share) result in FY16. 
Non-trading costs were $5.1 million for the year (compared with $0.5 million in FY16).

Total store sales of $497.2 million were up $109.6 million (+28.3%) on the previous year’s sales. Most of the growth ($97.2 million) came from the acquisition of the 42 KFC stores in Australia. However the New Zealand business grew sales by $12.4 million on prior year, mainly from the KFC New Zealand operations.

Group revenues for the year were $517.5 million (up 28.1%) with continued increases in sales of ingredients and packaging materials to independent franchisees. 

Store EBITDA (before G&amp;A costs) was up by $19.3 million (+28.8%) to $86.2 million, $15.0 million of which came from KFC Australia. 

Year-end store numbers were 212, with New Zealand totaling 170, three down on prior year, largely because of sales of Pizza Hut stores to independent franchisees. However the KFC Australian acquisition brought a further 42 stores into the network.

EBITDA 61.4 57.2 +4.3 +7.5%
EBITDA as % of  Sales 20.7% 20.2% - +0.5%

KFC had its best ever year in terms of sales and profitability with sales of $296.5 million, an increase of $13.9 million or +4.9% on the prior year. 

Same store sales growth started slowly with the first half up 1.9%. However the brand built stronger momentum as the year progressed, finishing at +7.1% growth for the last quarter of the year to a total of +3.6% for the full year (rolling over +6.3% for FY16).

The brand continues to enjoy the momentum of the store transformation programme, together with the benefits of further increases in marketing expenditure and some successful new product releases.

Margins improved commensurate with sales, with a benign ingredient cost environment and increased store efficiencies offsetting increasing labour costs. The brand finished the year with an EBITDA of $61.4 million, another new record for the brand. This represents an increase of $4.3 million or +7.5% on FY16. As a percentage of sales, brand EBITDA improved from 20.2% in FY16 to 20.7% this year.

With the last major transformation completed this year, the store network rebuilding programme that the brand embarked upon over ten years ago is now complete. The programme has seen a total refurbishment of the KFC store network at a cost of $100 million and has resulted in the New Zealand KFC business growing from $172 million sales in 2006 to nearly $300 million this year and EBITDA more than doubling from less than $30 million to over $60 million over the same time.

The company recognizes the importance of continued re-investment in its stores and completed 11 major store upgrades and 10 minor refurbishments over the course of the year. 

Store numbers increased to 92 with the opening of a new store at Rolleston in November 2016.

The company opened one new Pizza Hut store during the year in LynnMall and oversaw four additional stores which were opened by independent franchisees. By year end Restaurant Brands still retained a total of 35 stores and independent franchisees had 58 stores. Sales from the 93 store Pizza Hut network were $91.6 million, an increase of 6.4% on prior year.

Total sales from stores operated by Restaurant Brands were down 9.8% over the year to $40.5 million, due to lower store numbers as the company sold a further four stores to independent franchisees.

Same store sales for company stores grew 3.6% over the year with a slightly stronger first half.

Earnings from company stores reduced slightly because of the sale of more of the profitable stores to independent franchisees and some increases in labour and ingredient costs. EBITDA for the year was $4.1 million, down $0.8 million on FY16. This represented an EBITDA margin of 10.0% of sales versus 10.9% last year, but still within the company’s expected margin range.

Demand from independent franchisees remains strong for both purchases of Restaurant Brands’ stores and new store construction in greenfield locations.

As the company’s smallest brand, Starbucks Coffee has yet again made a reliable and sustainable contribution to the overall group result. 

Total sales at $26.7 million were marginally down on prior year, because of the end-of-lease closure of the Aotea Square store in Auckland. Same store sales however were up a healthy 4.5%.  

Despite some weakening of the NZD/USD exchange rate, increased volumes and continuing operating efficiencies delivered a further increase in earnings to a new high of $4.8 million (17.8% of sales).

With the Aotea Square closure store numbers are now 24. 

With the 20th anniversary of the first store opening in the country coming up next year the company is in discussions with the franchisor on potential franchise renewal options.

The Carl’s Jr. brand continued to make steady progress towards building critical mass and long term financial viability.

Sales were up 9.0% to $36.3 million, with the impact of new store openings in Church Corner and Hornby in  Christchurch. Whilst same store sales for the brand were -3.8%, they improved over the year and were positive for the second half.

Margins continued to improve with lower input costs, although beef prices remain stubbornly high. Maintaining the strategy of accelerating advertising expenditure to try and build brand presence also adversely impacted margins. The resultant EBITDA of $1.0 million (2.7% of sales) was $0.6 million or 121% up on FY16 and indicative of the continued improvement in brand performance.

Store numbers increased by one to 19 with the two openings offset by the closure of the Otahuhu store.

The addition of the 42 QSR Pty Limited (“QSR”) KFC stores in New South Wales Australia, completed on 27 April 2016 gave a considerable boost to the Company’s results, adding $97.2 million in sales and $15.0 million in EBITDA for the 10 month period.

The purchase of QSR for a consideration of $89.4 million was settled by the issue of five million Restaurant Brands shares (at a set price of $4.16). Market value of the shares at settlement was $25.5 million with the balance of $63.9 million in bank debt.

The acquisition represents a strategic move into the Australian market, buying a well-run profitable company which will provide a sound base for future expansion opportunities. 

The business has seen further growth in store numbers after balance date with five further KFC stores being acquired from independent franchisees, two new stores under construction and the potential purchase of a number of Yum!-owned stores in the market under active consideration. 

Corporate and Other Costs

G&amp;A (above store overheads) at $20.4 million were $4.0 million (23.9%) up on prior year. Most ($3.6 million) of this increase arose from the additional G&amp;A in the Australian business. Total G&amp;A remains at 3.9% of total revenues, within the company’s 4.0% target.

The board is currently considering a long term incentive scheme for the senior management team. 

Group non-trading charges were $5.1 million for the year ($0.5 million in FY16).  There were some gains on the disposal of Pizza Hut stores of $0.7 million and the sale and leaseback of a KFC store of $0.4 million. These gains were however offset by store closure costs of $1.7 million (primarily Carl’s Jr. Otahuhu), legal and due diligence costs on the Hawaiian acquisition of $1.5 million and stamp duty on settlement of the QSR Australia purchase of $2.1 million.

Depreciation charges at $22.2 million were up $5.6 million on the prior year, largely as a result of the QSR acquisition ($4.6 million). New Zealand operations had an increase in depreciation of $1.0 million, mainly from the KFC business.

Interest and funding costs at $2.3 million were $1.3 million up on prior year. Bank interest rates (inclusive of margins) for the year averaged 4.1% compared with 4.8% in FY16.

The company’s cash flows continue to be very robust. Operating cash flows were $47.9 million for the year, up $3.6 million on prior year. The impact of working capital movements was minimal this year at -$1.0 million, compared with a +$4.5 million benefit in FY16.

Net investing cash outflows rose significantly to $79.0 million, compared with $15.3 million in FY16. $63.9 million of the increase was attributable to settlement of the QSR acquisition in Australia.

Financing cash flows for the year showed a net inflow of $99.2 million, compared with the previous year’s net outflow of $29.4 million. The reasons for the significant (and largely one-off) turnaround were the increase in borrowings for the Australian acquisition and the share capital raised of $91.1 million (net) for the Hawaiian acquisition that had not settled by balance date. Dividend payments took $22.6 million versus $19.6 million in FY16. 

Total assets at year-end were up significantly to $302.4 million (FY16 $139.8 million) on the strength of the Australian acquisition and the capital raising for the Hawaiian acquisition. Current assets were up $70.7 million to $83.3 million because of the cash raised for the Hawaiian settlement which was still pending at balance date. Non-current assets were up $91.9 million to $219.1 million with the impact of goodwill and leasehold improvements, plant and equipment acquired on the QSR purchase.

Total liabilities were up $46.1 million to $110.3 million largely because of increased borrowings for the QSR acquisition. 

Year-end shareholders’ funds of $192.1 million were $116.4 million up on prior year because of the capital raising for the Hawaiian acquisition. 

The balance sheet remains conservative with a gearing ratio of 19% (FY16: 13%), but was artificially low at balance date pending completion of the Hawaiian acquisition.

Dividend   

Directors have declared a final fully imputed dividend of 13.5 cents per share.  This, together with the interim dividend of 9.5 cents per share, makes a full year dividend of 23.0 cents per share (up 2.0 cents on FY16). 

The final dividend of 13.5 cents per ordinary share will be payable on 23 June 2017 to all shareholders on the register on 9 June 2017.  A supplementary dividend of 2.3824 cents per share will be paid to all overseas shareholders at the same time.

The re-introduction of a dividend reinvestment plan for the company is currently being evaluated, with a decision to be announced before the FY18 interim dividend. 

Hawaiian Acquisition

On 26 October 2016, Restaurant Brands entered into agreements to purchase 100% of the shares in Pacific Island Restaurants Inc (PIR) for $US105 million. PIR is the sole Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchisee in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. PIR’s store network includes 37 Taco Bell stores and 45 Pizza Hut stores. 

The acquisition, which was finally settled on 7 March 2017 (in the new financial year), was funded by a combination of (US dollar) debt and equity. The company undertook a successful capital raising in November 2016 through an Accelerated Renounceable Entitlement Offer (AREO) that saw mainly existing shareholders subscribe for 19,972,101 shares for a total consideration of $94 million.

On a full year basis the Hawaiian business is expected to deliver total sales in the vicinity of $180 million and a store EBITDA of $27 million.
  
Outlook

The reported profit for the year at $26.0 million was 7.8% up on prior year, although the underlying result was considerably higher after adjusting for the significant non-trading items incurred in completing the two acquisitions in Australia and Hawaii. The resultant $30.6 million NPAT (excluding non-trading) was up 26.3% on prior year and included a solid contribution from the KFC Australia business.

The new financial year has seen a continuation of the strong trading performance across all four New Zealand brands seen over the FY17 year and both new acquisitions in Australia and Hawaii are currently delivering results in line with their business case projections. 
 
The company is not anticipating any significant changes in the economic and competitive environment or unusual costs for the new financial year. Therefore with a consistent domestic performance, a full year’s trading from the QSR business in Australia and a 51 week contribution from the Hawaiian acquisition, directors expect that the company will deliver an NPAT (excluding non-trading) result in the new financial year in the vicinity of $40 million. More details will be provided at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Annual Shareholders' Meeting

The Annual Shareholders' Meeting for the company will be held in Auckland on 23 June 2017.

Restaurant Brands Group
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
For the 52 week period ended 27 February 2017

The Group results are prepared in accordance with New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“GAAP”) and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).  These financial statements include non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS.  The non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation are as follows:

1. EBITDA before G&amp;A.  The Group calculates Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) before G&amp;A (general and administration expenses) by taking net profit before taxation and adding back (or deducting) net financing expenses, non-trading items, depreciation, amortisation and G&amp;A.  The Group also refers to this measure as Concept EBITDA before G&amp;A.

The term Concept refers to the Group’s five operating segments comprising the New Zealand segments (KFC, Pizza Hut, Starbucks Coffee and Carl’s Jr.) and KFC Australia.  The term G&amp;A represents non-store related overheads.

2. EBIT before non-trading.  Earnings before interest and taxation (“EBIT”) before non-trading is calculated by taking net profit before taxation and adding back (or deducting) net financing expenses and non-trading items. 

3. Non-trading items.  Non-trading items represent amounts the Group considers unrelated to the day to day operational performance of the Group.  Excluding non-trading items enables the Group to measure underlying trends of the business and monitor performance on a consistent basis.

4. EBIT after non-trading items.  The Group calculates EBIT after non-trading items by taking net profit before taxation and adding back net financing expenses.  

5. Total NPAT excluding non-trading.  Total Net Profit After Taxation (“NPAT”) excluding non-trading items is calculated by taking profit after taxation attributable to shareholders and adding back (or deducting) non-trading items whilst also allowing for any tax impact of those items.

6. Capital expenditure including intangibles.  Capital expenditure including intangibles represents additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

The Group believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance and position of the Group but that they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with IFRS.  Non-GAAP measures as reported by the Group may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

The following is a reconciliation between these non-GAAP measures and net profit after taxation:

    Impact of ex-Cyclone Cook
    8:32am, 18 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX Release
 
18 April 2017
 
IMPACT OF EX-CYCLONE COOK

The directors of Scales Corporation Limited (NZX:SCL) advise that ex-Cyclone Cook has had a minimal impact on Horticulture Division subsidiary Mr Apple’s 2017 apple harvest.

The high winds and heavy rain in the Hawke’s Bay on the evening of Thursday 13 April resulted in losses with some apples blown from trees.

At this time these losses are estimated to be within normally expected tolerances.

    Green light for Ryman Healthcare’s second Melbourne village
    12:39pm, 29 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  Green light for Ryman Healthcare’s second Melbourne village
 
Way clear to start work on new Brandon Park village

The City of Monash has approved Ryman Healthcare’s plan to build a new retirement village at Brandon Park in Melbourne.

Ryman’s construction team will start preliminary work on the village after Monash councillors last night approved plans to build on a vacant 5.6-hectare site right next door to the Brandon Park Shopping Centre. 

The village will include 199 aged care rooms, 94 serviced apartments and 328 independent two and three bedroomed apartments. Other amenities include an indoor swimming pool, movie theatre, café, hair and beauty salons and a bowling green. The village will eventually be home to more than 700 retirees.

Brandon Park is Ryman’s second village in Melbourne, and the village’s first residents are expected to move into their new apartments in 2018.

Ryman Managing Director Simon Challies said getting the green light for Brandon Park was great news and a major milestone for the company

“Sites this large in urban Melbourne are rare and the village is as large as anything we have built before,’’ Mr Challies said.  “It is a big commitment and it signals that we mean business in Melbourne.’’

 “We’ve already had keen interest from 350 potential residents. Our construction team has been gearing up to get started and we will begin work right away.’’

Ryman’s first village in Melbourne was opened in 2014 and sold faster than anticipated. Mr Challies said it had proven that Ryman’s model of combining independent living apartments with a care centre on the same campus was well suited to Melbourne.
 
“Following on from that success we committed to matching our New Zealand build rate in Australia. We set a target of building five villages by 2020 in Australia, and we are now well on the way with another three villages in the design phase right now.’’

“We learned a lot first time around and we have built a great team in Melbourne who have been keen to get going on the next project. We’ve had a great welcome to the area from the people of Monash and we are pleased the council has supported this proposal,’’ Mr Challies said.

“We can now get on and build a beautiful new village so that residents who love the area and want to stay can do so with the peace of mind of knowing there is care for them if they need it.’’

The new village is likely to appeal to residents from Wheelers Hill, Glen Waverley, Mount Waverley, and Mulgrave. There are 100,000 people in the immediate suburbs and Monash has been identified as an area of Melbourne with an ageing population that needs additional care beds.  

Mr Challies said the next step was to find an appropriate name for the village. Ryman Healthcare names all its villages after significant locals. Its first Melbourne village was named after Sir Edward Weary Dunlop, the surgeon who worked tirelessly to keep prisoners of war alive on the Burma Railway during World War 2.

“We’d love to hear naming suggestions – we’ve had a lot in already and we’d like to make to decision in the next few months.’’

Ryman Healthcare has been in business since 1984 and Brandon Park is the company’s thirty second village.

Ryman’s other sites:

Burwood East: The 2.5-hectare site on Middleborough Rd in Burwood East is part of a large $500 million Frasers Property Australia redevelopment of the wider 20.5-hectare site. Design work is well under way for the village which will be a cornerstone of one of Melbourne’s largest urban redevelopment projects.

Coburg: The 1.2 ha Coburg site is about 10km from Melbourne’s CBD, and is well connected to the city by transport links. The site, which was formerly a school, had been previously approved for a large 11-storey residential development by the City of Moreland. 

Moondah Estate, Mount Eliza: The 8.9 hectare Moondah Estate site is about 45 minutes from Melbourne’s CBD and was built as a country estate in 1888 and has been most recently used as a Melbourne Business School campus. The site includes 240m of beachfront land and stunning sea views on the Mornington Peninsula. 

About Ryman: Ryman Healthcare was founded in Christchurch in 1984 and owns and operates 31 retirement villages in New Zealand and Australia. Ryman villages are home to 10,000 residents, and the company employs 4,500 staff.

    JOINT VENTURE IN USA 
    8:40am,  3 Mar 2017 | JOINTV
  

  T&amp;G Global Limited (T&amp;G Global) and Grandview Brokerage Limited (GBL), a 65% owned subsidiary of Total Produce plc (Ireland), have agreed to a joint venture in two US based produce businesses which will provide their respective grower suppliers with access to both US domestic and international customers. 

GBL, which is 35% owned by its President, John Anderson, is the parent company of the Vancouver headquartered Oppenheimer Group.

T&amp;G Global has agreed to:

1.  increase its shareholder interest in the US produce marketing and distribution business David Oppenheimer and Company (Oppy US), from 15% to 39.4%.  GBL will own the other 60.6% shareholder interest in Oppy US (giving Total Produce plc an indirect 39.4% interest in Oppy US);

2.  reduce T&amp;G Global’s 15% interest in David Oppenheimer Transport (the transport business of Oppenheimer Group) to approximately 6%, GBL will have an interest in the other 9%;and

3.  sell 50% of its shareholder interest in Delica North America Inc, the legal company name of T&amp;G Global’s US export business, T&amp;G Global North America, to GBL, leaving T&amp;G Global with a 50% shareholder interest in this business. 

T&amp;G Global additional 24.4% interest in Oppy US is valued at approximately $11.4m.  T&amp;G Global’s sale of 50% of Delica North America Inc is valued at approximately $8.6m.  GBL’s 9% interest in David Oppenheimer Transport is valued at approximately $2m.  Therefore, the net consideration payable by T&amp;G Global to GBL for these transactions will be approximately $0.8m.
The transactions are expected to complete at the end of the month.
T&amp;G Global Limited CEO, Alastair Hulbert says T&amp;G Global has enjoyed a strong and successful partnership with Oppy US and its management team for many years and looks forward to working closer with the team and with Total Produce plc.
“Our increased shareholding in Oppy US recognises the growing importance we place on the US market for T&amp;G produce, in particular our Jazz and Envy PVR apple brands and the vital role Oppy US is playing in this success. Aligning our US export business T&amp;G Global North America with the Oppenheimer Group will enable T&amp;G Global to present grower suppliers to both US and international customers and further strengthen its ability to service and support the needs of these US domestic and international customers and the consumers of fresh produce.”
Oppy US’s key produce categories in the US align with T&amp;G Global’s international categories including berries, citrus, kiwifruit, tomatoes, grapes and pipfruit.  Oppy US is one of three US-based licensed agents for T&amp;G Global’s proprietary varieties of pipfruit, namely Jazz, Envy and Pacific Rose. The other two agents are Rainer Fruit Company and CMI.

    Turners Business Update and FY17 Guidance
    5:15pm, 28 Mar 2017 | FORECAST
  

  28 March 2017

Company Announcement

TURNERS BUSINESS UPDATE AND FY17 GUIDANCE

• Positive progress being made on key initiatives including integration of Autosure insurance; establishment of the securitisation funding model; and growth in demand for the MTF non-recourse finance product.
• FY17 Guidance: Net Profit Before Tax expected to be between $24.0 million and $24.5 million
• Q3 dividend declared at 4 cents per share, taking the total of the 3 interim year-to-date dividends to 10 cents per share.
• The Company advises that it is likely to undertake a dual listing on the ASX in FY18.

Integrated automotive financial services group, Turners Limited (NZX:TNR), is making positive progress on a number of key business initiatives and has today provided guidance for the full year to 31 March 2017 of Net Profit Before Tax of between $24.0 million and $24.5 million. The Automotive Retail division continues to perform strongly and the multi-channel approach continues to deliver benefits for margins and finance sales. Buy Right Cars Group was the latest acquisition for the group and the business is performing in-line with expectations. The flow of the Buy Right Cars finance contracts into the Turners Limited finance business is now gaining momentum. 

The Finance segment continues to transition towards lower risk, lower margin lending. The new non-recourse lending product for MTF, which was officially launched to the MTF network early this year in a staged roll-out, is gaining traction and building quickly, with over $14 million in loans written since the pilot started in early December 2016. The growth of the book and adoption by MTF originators has exceeded expectations, and will contribute positively to FY18 earnings. 

The securitisation programme is now fully implemented and operating, with credit approval for an initial $150 million limit from BNZ. This has been a significant project for Turners and will reduce the cost of funds, create further finance growth headroom and strengthen Turners’ funding base for its finance business.

In the Insurance segment, Turners has now received approval from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for the transfer of the Autosure portfolio to Turners. The integration of Autosure into the Turners group is expected to be completed by the end of the FY17 financial year, with profit contributions from this business commencing in FY18. 

Based on the positive ongoing performance of the company, the Board has declared a Q3 fully imputed dividend of 4 cents per share, taking year to date dividends to 10 cents per share. Any final dividend will be declared following announcement of the FY17 results and would be paid in June 2017.

Growth remains a priority for Turners, through both M&amp;A and by leveraging opportunities within each business. Turners is likely to undertake a foreign-exempt compliance listing on the ASX, providing it with access to a larger capital market to support its growth strategy. 

CEO of Turners, Todd Hunter, said: “We have successfully integrated the value accretive acquisitions of Buy Right Cars and Autosure into our business in the past 6 months, and we have made good progress on a number of important initiatives, which all contribute and support the future growth of Turners.”

“There are numerous growth opportunities available to us in the fragmented automotive market and we have a disciplined approach to identifying and assessing those that best fit our business and will add value to our shareholders. We are looking forward to another year of strong year of growth in FY18.”

Turners will announce its FY17 financial results and final dividend in late May 2017.

    Trade Me Jobs - quarterly NZ jobs release
    8:50am,  6 Apr 2017 | GENERAL
  

   
6 April 2017

New Zealand job market booming but wages languish

The New Zealand employment market remains extremely strong with job listings surging by more than 15 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017, according to the analysis of over 65,000 vacancies advertised on Trade Me Jobs. 

Head of Trade Me Jobs Jeremy Wade said it was the third consecutive quarter that the percentage of new listings on the site had jumped by double digits, but wage inflation was benign. “The job market is in great health and we’ve seen incredible jumps in the number of roles advertised but, with a few exceptions, wage growth has been surprisingly flat by comparison.

“While increased migration has probably muted wage growth to date, we think the tide is going to turn.  Employers are unlikely to continue finding the right people unless they tempt passive job seekers with the lure of better pay. Money talks and we suspect Kiwi employers will need to meet the job market with higher salaries in the coming months.

Job hunters should expect more 

Mr Wade said the average salary for the quarter was basically flat, and down three per cent on the last quarter of 2016. “We’re seeing small increases in average pay across growth industries such as Construction and Customer Service, but overall wages aren’t matching demand.

“The number of roles advertised has exploded in recent months which in turn means that the average number of applications per role has dropped 13 per cent on this time last year. Job hunters can be more selective which makes it harder to fill these roles. 

“Some employers have looked to immigration channels to address this shortage. Immigration alone won’t correct the shortfall, though it may be suppressing wage growth. We think employers are going to have to work hard on their employment brand and/or improve salary packages to lure people away from their current jobs or to retain existing staff.”

Mr Wade said ANZ estimated the job vacancy rate for New Zealand companies is at its highest point since 1994. “If that’s true, then a wage war is just around the corner and job hunters can expect to see a bigger wage packet dangled in front of them.”

Auckland city pushes Wellington aside on pay

For the first time since mid-2014, Auckland City has wrestled the average highest pay ($71,817) away from Wellington City ($67,592). Mr Wade said both Wellington and Auckland had seen ‘huge’ growth in new job listings, up 14 per cent and 15.9 per cent respectively. 

“Auckland employers are feeling the pinch when trying to employ new people and have been putting more money on the table. There is going to be a neck-and-neck battle between the Capital and the City of Sails as they compete for top talent.”

Regions booming

Mr Wade said it’s boom time in the regions as job growth in most areas outstripping the main centres.  “Almost every region in the country had double-digit percentage jumps in new listings compared to last year, led by Gisborne (up 40 per cent), the Waikato (up 36.5 per cent) and West Coast (up 32.4 per cent). 

“Some of these regions have pretty small job markets but these numbers are incredible. The West Coast has double the listings it had last year which is positive news for the local economy. The jump in new listings in the regions has been led by Transport &amp; Logistics, Manufacturing &amp; Operations and Construction sectors.”

The only region to fall compared to this time last year was Canterbury (down 2 per cent) which Mr Wade said was predominantly down to a decrease in the number of Trades &amp; Services roles available. “The year-on-year decrease is a reflection of the Canterbury job market recalibrating from its post-quake building boom. Recent job listing volumes suggest the Canterbury job market looks to be stabilising and we don’t expect to see it declining for much longer.”

In the sectors

Of the 26 sectors monitored by Trade Me Jobs, only five had less listings than the same quarter last year. As with the regions, most sectors reported double-digit increases.

Sectors that did particularly well were Manufacturing &amp; operations (up 34.9 per cent), Retail (up 31.3 per cent) and Property (up 30.7 per cent). 

“The biggest fall amongst the sectors was Banking, finance &amp; insurance (down 21.4 per cent) which we put down to ongoing belt tightening from the major banks,” says Mr Wade.

Technology continues to be the most lucrative career option on Trade Me Jobs, with all five of the top salary spots taken by IT roles. IT architects were number one again with an average salary of $144,563.  

In the lowest paid roles on Trade Me Jobs there was modest wage growth for Housekeeping (up 3.3 per cent), Caregivers (0.6 per cent), Retail assistants (2.6 per cent) and Bar/Barista (3.5 per cent) roles. “We expect to see the wages for roles like this continue to grow further as the new minimum wage comes into effect.”

Completion of the sale of the Clearwood Business is to occur (subject to satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the sale) on 28 April 2017. Subject to receipt of final High Court orders relating to the Capital Return, one out of every two Tenon shares on issue will be cancelled, and a Capital Return of U$1.327 per existing share (or US$2.654 for every ordinary share cancelled) is expected to be made on or shortly after completion of the sale. The ‘ex-date’ for Tenon shares (assuming Final High Court orders are received on 7 April 2017) is 26 April 2017. 

As previously disclosed to the market, after the completion of the Clearwood sale, Tenon will have no operating assets and intends to enter a wind-down phase, including de-listing from the NZX Main Board on 31 July 2017, and eventual liquidation of the business. Resolutions relating to each of these matters were also approved by shareholders.
The following is a summary of the voting.

    Summerset Completes Loan Facility Refinance
    1:52pm, 31 Mar 2017 | GENERAL
  

  NZX &amp; ASX RELEASE

31 MARCH 2017

SUMMERSET COMPLETES LOAN FACILITY REFINANCE

Summerset Group has completed a NZ$600 million syndicated loan facility refinance.

This is an increase from the NZ$450 million syndicated loan facility that was previously in place, and allows the Group to continue to fund growth initiatives across both existing and future retirement villages.

The Group currently has NZ$283 million of debt, being 47% of the NZ$600 million now in place, leaving substantive headroom for future development or unexpected economic cycle events.

Summerset Group Chief Executive Officer Julian Cook said Summerset continues to receive strong support from financial institutions. “We adopt a prudent approach to debt levels and having conservative levels of headroom puts us in good shape for continued development, and also in the event of a property downturn.  

“Completing this refinance provides strong levels of certainty for future years for funding of development projects and continued growth of the business.”

The syndicated loan facility comprises tranches which are a mix of 3.4 and 5 years, with 37.5% maturing in August 2020 and 62.5% maturing in March 2022. The facility is intended to be used for funding development projects.

The gearing ratio for the Group at its balance date on 31 December 2016 was 32.7%, down from 37.1% at 31 December 2015.

The loan facility syndicate comprises ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, Bank of New Zealand and ASB Bank Limited.

    1Q17 Metrics - Sales of Occupation Rights
    8:30am,  5 Apr 2017 | QUARTER
  

  NZX &amp; ASX RELEASE

5 APRIL 2017

1Q17 METRICS – SALES OF OCCUPATION RIGHTS 

Summerset Group achieved 171 sales for the quarter ending 31 March 2017, comprising 97 new sales and 74 resales.  

This is a 41% increase on the first quarter of 2016, with both new sales and resales tracking strongly.

Summerset CEO Julian Cook said he was pleased with the results for the first quarter of 2017.

“Both new sales and resales were strong, with new sales driven by the development pipeline across a number of villages and resales driven by increased levels of retirement units becoming available for resale. We continue to see good levels of demand across all areas of the country. 

“The outlook for the balance of the year looks positive with good presale levels on projects delivering through this year. We note that our construction programme sees retirement unit deliveries weighted to the second half of the year and we expect the split of new sales across the year to be in line with this.”

Summerset recently announced the completion of a NZ$600 million syndicated loan facility refinance, to allow the Group to continue to fund future growth initiatives.

    South Port NZ Ltd - Interim Report to 31 December 2016
    4:39pm,  9 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  NZX &amp; Media Statement

SOUTH PORT INTERIM PROFIT ANNOUNCEMENT

9 February 2017

South Port interim tracks prior guidance

With the overall cargo volume at the port of Bluff maintaining the solid pattern of the previous year, South Port New Zealand’s net profit for the first six months of 2017 was better than expected at $4.10 million.

Although, the result is below the prior period in 2016 of $5.06 million, several anticipated factors impacted on this lower interim result including:

 The interim profit contribution reported in FY2016 was inflated due largely to R&amp;M scheduling (NPAT half year $5.06 million versus full year $8.71 million);

 An increased number of significant R&amp;M projects being undertaken in the current period, as signalled in the FY16 profit release and Annual Meeting comments; and

 Notably lower cold storage income being generated in first six months of FY17.

The result was foreshadowed by the closing comments of the FY16 Review of Operations which outlined the following:

 “Based on all known factors at the date of compiling this Report, South Port estimates that earnings in the next financial year are likely to reduce by approximately 15%.”

“Total cargo activity registered at 1,517,000 tonnes, which aligns closely with the 1,512,000 tonnes throughput of the prior year interim period,” said the Chief Executive, Mr Mark O’Connor.

“Some variances were evident within individual cargo categories.  Specifically petroleum (-23,000T) and stock food ( 30,000T) showed declines, whilst logs (+39,000T) and woodchips (+30,000T) continued to show strength.

Containerised cargo provided an encouraging lift of around 8% despite negative pressure being evident for agri imports such as specialised fertiliser, stock food and minerals.

While there have been some recent reductions in the Global Dairy Trade (GDT) auction results, international dairy commodity prices, on a trend basis, lifted consistently over the second half of 2016.
  
This is encouraging news for the sector with farmers having sustained two difficult seasons where some balance sheets would have been stretched to breaking point.

While commentators are not predicting the same highs of earlier cycles, the current forecast pay out levels will offer greater confidence to operators in the dairy industry.  A close watch on possible volume increases in Europe and USA will continue as these two global producers have the ability to dramatically influence the dairy supply side.”

The Intermodal Freight Centre (IFC) commenced operations in mid July 2016 and has provided a varied range of services to freight forwarders, transport operators and a mix of import and exports parties.  Focusing predominantly on import cargoes, containerised volumes have met expectations which was particularly pleasing considering the reduced consumables spend in the dairy sector.  Increased regional container related service competition has also benefited import and export businesses operating in Southland.
 
Further consolidation of container shipping lines and the creation of new alliances occurred during 2016.  Although no noticeable international rate improvement is evident to date, it is highly likely that this will be necessary for container lines to achieve sustainable profitability.

This consolidation caused a number of the larger land based container terminals to consider forming alliances and operating as a bloc when negotiating agreements with container lines.

Cold storage activity was particularly subdued in the first half of FY17 due to a limited carry-over of product from the previous export season, less total volume requiring cold storage in the current season to date and the rapid movement of product to market.  A serious fire at the Bluff based plant of pet food processor Wilbur Ellis in April 2016, removed their seasonal storage requirement until early 2017, when the plant became operational again.

OUTLOOK

“A reasonably stable economic picture should enable South Port’s customers to generate consistent cargo flows in the second half of 2017”, said Mr Chapman.   “South Port’s main product flows (logs/fertiliser/NZAS cargo/dairy/petroleum) are expected to track budget expectations in the six month period to 30 June 2017.”

As previously reported, a number of significant infrastructural assets require a much greater level of R&amp;M expenditure and this has been programmed to extend their effective lives.

“The reported FY17 interim profit is ahead of our earlier forecast and therefore some upside potential exists for the full year result” [albeit that it is still expected to be less than the FY16 NPAT], said the Chairman of South Port, Mr Rex Chapman.

South Port estimates that its full year earnings should fall in the range of $7.75 million to $8.0 million (FY16 - $8.7 million).

Based on achieving a result in this range, the Directors have declared a fully imputed interim dividend of 7.50 cents per share (2016 – 7.50 cents) payable on 7 March 2017 and expect that the full year dividend payment will be consistent with the previous year.

    South Port NZ - 2017 Interim Report Email to Shareholders

  South Port New Zealand Limited – Interim Report and Interim Dividend Advice
Dear Shareholder

Interim Report
South Port New Zealand’s Interim Report for the period ended 31 December 2016 is now available on our website.  You can view the Report here:

http://www.southport.co.nz/assets/reports/Interim_Report_to_31_December_2016.pdf

South Port’s NPAT for the first six months of FY2017 reflected a better than expected level of $4.10M (FY2016 - $5.06M).  Several factors impacted on this lower interim result including:

• An increased number of significant R&amp;M projects being undertaken in the current period (as well as over the next several years), as signalled in the FY2016 profit release and Annual Meeting comments; and
• Notably lower cold storage income being generated in the first six months of FY2017.

A reasonably stable economic picture should enable South Port’s customers to generate consistent cargo flows in the second half of FY2017.  Based on all known factors at present, South Port estimates that its full year earnings should fall in the range of $7.75M to $8.0M (FY2016 - $8.7M).

Performance Snapshot
• Record cargo of 1,517,000 tonnes for the six month period compared to 1,512,000 tonnes in the previous interim period
• The new Intermodal Freight Centre (IFC) commenced operations in Invercargill in mid-July 2016 providing a varied range of services to freight forwarders, transport operators and import/export parties
• Interim NPAT down 19% to $4.10M (31 December 2015 - $5.06M) owing to the reasons outlined above (R&amp;M increase and lower cold storage contribution)
• Operating revenue from continuing operations down 3% to $17.4M

Interim NPAT to 31 Dec 2016      Interim Dividend
$4.10m                          7.50cps (no change)

Interim Dividend
The South Port interim dividend of 7.50 cents per share for the half year ending 31 December 2016 has been paid to your nominated bank account today.

Your electronic dividend advice is now available from the Link Investor Centre (South Port’s Share Registry).

    Mark O’Connor to depart Bluff Port
    10:27am, 24 Mar 2017 | OFFICE
  

  MEDIA RELEASE

Mark O’Connor to depart Bluff Port 

South Port NZ Limited Chief Executive, Mark O’Connor has tendered his resignation and will leave the Bluff Port operation in late October.

South Port Chairman, Rex Chapman commented that the timing of this decision had been signaled to the Board for a number of years.  The Board is naturally disappointed to lose a person of Mark’s calibre, particularly given the significant progress the Company has made over the last two decades while he has been at the helm.

Mark and his team have worked hard to deliver effective freight solutions for Southland based businesses and the Company is in excellent shape as it continues to focus on this clear objective.

In the most recent financial year South Port achieved a record cargo and profit, with volumes having lifted by 50% or approximately 1.0 million tonnes since 2009.  Other projects Mark has overseen included refocusing the business on the core freight delivery element, ensuring appropriate infrastructure existed to support bulk cargo growth (forestry/agri), maintaining container handling capability for the regional Port and establishing an Intermodal Freight Centre (IFC) in Invercargill.

During the period that Mark has served as CEO, South Port’s annual dividend increased from 5.5 cents per share to 26 cents while the share price has lifted from $0.86 to its current level of $5.35 (representing an increase in market capitalisation of around $120 million).  This is the market clearly conveying that the Company has performed very well during that time.
  
O’Connor stated, “Approximately 4 years ago I advised the South Port Board that when I turned 55 years, I would take a detour in the road and exit the port sector.  That date has come around quicker than I thought but it is appropriate for me to step back from a full time role and identify other projects which may be of interest.

After my departure in late October, I plan to take some time out and undertake some overseas travel.  Beyond that I will actively seek out some new Director positions where I can offer value.

It has been a privilege to operate in the CEO role for the past 17 years and to work for South Port for almost 25 years.  I have certainly appreciated the opportunity to lead a committed and talented group of individuals.
One of the key reasons I remained with the Company for such a long period was the capability and style of the people that I worked with (at all levels).  As a business, South Port provides variety in terms of different customers and projects to service freight.” 

O’Connor added, “I wish to thank the team in advance for the effort delivered and the tenacity they demonstrate on a consistent basis.  I have also appreciated the manner in which the South Port Board has guided the Company and I pay special tribute to Rex in his role as Chair.  Bluff Port occupies an important position in the supply chain landscape and it is vital that it continues to facilitate the efficient flow of regional exports and imports.  Decisions made by the Board and Management in recent years have always strived to ensure Southland based business have freight alternatives and that competitive tension exists in the marketplace.  Without these ingredients regional operations struggle to compete in international markets.
 
The challenges facing Southland have been highlighted in the SoRDS strategy and it is critical that Local Government pushes forward with the necessary steps to support the action plan linked to this strategy.  I have been encouraged by the level of effort contributed by business and other parties to ensure SoRDS succeeds and that Southland remains a healthy and vibrant part of New Zealand.”

The Board will commence the process of seeking a replacement for Mark immediately.

    Vector FY17 Interim Results
    8:30am, 24 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO 31 DECEMBER 2016
CREATING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

Highlights: 

- Net profit after tax from continuing operations  for the six months to 31 December 2016 rises 64.5% to $107.1 million
- Adjusted EBITDA  from continuing operations rises 1.4% to $257.0 million
- Group revenue from continuing operations rises 5.9% to $625.6 million
- New electricity and gas connections rise 19% to 6,490
- Smart meter fleet rises to 1.2 million. Deployment commences in Australia.
- Investments in new technology continue with the commissioning of a 2.3 MWh network battery in Glen Innes, the expansion of the home battery fleet to 445 from 291 and the expansion of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to 21 chargers.
- The Commerce Commission’s review of the Input Methodologies broadly positive – stability of approach, revenue cap, and supportive of investment in new technologies - providing regulatory certainty through to 2025. 
- Interim dividend increases by 0.25 cents per share to 8 cents per share 

New Zealand’s leading energy infrastructure company Vector today announces improved earnings as it continues to deploy new technologies to give choice and control to its customers and create new opportunities for growth.

Net profit after tax from continuing operations for the six months to 31 December 2016 rose 64.5% to $107.1 million, from $65.1 million in the same period last year.

The result was driven by growth in capital contributions - due to strong growth in Auckland - and lower finance costs as we repaid debt following the sale of Vector Gas in April 2016. It also included a $15.0 million one-off gain after the Court of Appeal ruled in Vector’s favour over the tax treatment of the sale of rights to use our Penrose to Hobson Street tunnel in Auckland.

Group revenue from continuing operations rose 5.9% to $625.6 million, from $590.6 million in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was up 1.4% to $257.0 million from $253.5 million in the same period last year.   

Adjusted EBITDA for the continuing regulated networks business decreased 0.4% to $195.7 million, from $196.4 million. A combined 19.0% increase in new electricity and gas connections was offset by the effects of warmer weather and the continuing decline in household power consumption. 

Adjusted EBITDA in the unregulated businesses rose 2.3% to $84.1 million from $82.2 million last year, with continuing growth in the New Zealand metering business and a one-off insurance settlement  offsetting the costs associated with the expansion of metering into Australia, the commercialisation of new technologies and ongoing low hydrocarbon prices.

Vector Chairman Michael Stiassny said: “Vector, with the support of its majority shareholder Entrust, is embracing the technological changes that are disrupting the energy sector.  We are doing this to ensure the ongoing relevance of our energy networks, to create solutions for our customers, and to create new opportunities for growth.”  

Key developments in the period included: the transition of Vector Gas to its new owners was completed in September; the commissioning of a 2.3 MWh network battery in Glen Innes; the continued expansion of our smart meter fleet, including our first deployment of meters in Australia (10,000 as at the date of this release); the expansion of the in-home battery fleet to 445 from 291 at the same time last year; and, with the support of our majority shareholder Entrust, the expansion of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the formation of a partnership with Auckland Council to drive energy efficiency in the city.
 
“Following the Commerce Commission’s review of the regulatory framework that governs our energy networks, we are doing all of this in an environment of stable economic regulation that is supportive of the change. New Zealand is in the fortunate position of having a regulator that recognises it must keep pace with the change and technological disruption in energy markets,” Mr Stiassny said.

Adjusted EBITDA (continuing operations) 257.0 253.5  1.4

FINANCIAL STRENGTH 

“Following the sale of Vector Gas, gearing  as at 31 December 2016 was 43.9% compared with 43.7% at the end of June 2016 and 53.4% at 31 December 2015. The proceeds from the sale of Vector Gas were applied to debt reduction. We are now redeploying this capital to support our new growth opportunities.

“Vector has increased its dividend by at least 0.25 cents every year since it listed in 2005.  The board has considered our growth prospects, the strength of our balance sheet following the sale of Vector Gas, and the stability in our regulatory regime through to 2025.  We remain committed to increasing dividends in line with historical practice, contingent on the company maintaining an investment-grade (BBB) credit rating and continuing to meet its investment requirements.  

“We will review this approach following the next electricity reset in 2020.  Our ability to maintain this approach beyond that point will be impacted by a range of factors, including the interest rates prevailing at the time of the next reset, and our success in re-investing the proceeds of the sale of Vector Gas.  

“Accordingly, the directors have declared an interim dividend of 8.0 cents per share, up 0.25 cents on the prior year’s interim dividend of 7.75 cents per share. The record date for dividend entitlements is 30 March 2017 and the payment date is 13 April 2017,” Mr Stiassny said.  

Vector Group Chief Executive Simon Mackenzie said: “Vector has long understood that new energy technologies such as smart meters, batteries, solar panels, new software and energy management solutions and electric vehicles would disrupt and transform our industry. Rather than resist, we decided to embrace change for three key reasons. 

“Firstly, technology is providing alternative ways to enhance our network, and delivering tangible economic benefits. Secondly, technology is significantly augmenting our ability to deliver solutions that give customers the choice and control they want in the management of their energy needs. Finally, technology is facilitating Vector’s drive to create a sustainable and environmentally responsible company.

“We are determined to develop solutions that are right for Auckland and right for consumers, both now and in our new energy future. Our first installation of a utility-scale battery in Glen Innes is tangible evidence of this approach, but this thinking permeates all aspects of our business.” 

OUTLOOK:

Mr Stiassny concluded: “Vector is excited by the opportunities that are emerging within the energy sector.  We take comfort in the new maturity we are seeing in the regulation of our energy networks. We are looking forward to the remainder of this financial year with confidence and continue to target adjusted EBITDA broadly in line with last year’s result, and towards the top end of guidance given in August of last year.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Vector’s standard profit measure prepared under New Zealand Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) is net profit. Vector has used non-GAAP profit measures when discussing financial performance in this document. The directors and management believe that these measures provide useful information as they are used internally to evaluate performance of business units, to establish operational goals and to allocate resources. For a more comprehensive discussion on the use of non-GAAP profit measures, please refer to the policy ‘Reporting non-GAAP profit measures’ available on our website (vector.co.nz).

Non-GAAP profit measures are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS (New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards) and are not uniformly defined, therefore the non-GAAP profit measures reported in this document may not be comparable with those that other companies report and should not be viewed in isolation from or considered as a substitute for measures reported by Vector in accordance with NZ IFRS.

    Wynyard Announces Voluntary Administration
    8:45am, 25 Oct 2016 | GENERAL
  

  25 October 2016 - The Board of Wynyard Group today regrets to inform shareholders that it has placed the company into voluntary administration. 
KordaMentha partners, Neale Jackson and Grant Graham, have been appointed as administrators of the company.    

The Board considered all available options including potentially raising additional capital and drawing on the $10 million loan but concluded that neither raising further equity nor incurring debt was in the best interests of the company, its shareholders or other stakeholders.

The Board believes this is the right decision under the circumstances, in order to ensure an environment where all options can be fully explored to retain the value in the business. 

The Board acknowledges the significance of its decision for shareholders, staff and customers; and will work with KordaMentha to support these parties as it moves quickly through this process.

At this point, Wynyard will be making no further comment on the voluntary administration process.

  Wynyard Group placed in voluntary administration

Wynyard Group (NZX: WYN) was today placed into voluntary administration (VA), along with its trading subsidiary Wynyard NZ.

KordaMentha partners, Grant Graham and Neale Jackson were appointed Administrators.

From today, the Administrators have taken full control of the company.

“As Administrators, we are focused on identifying any strategies to realise value for the intellectual property Wynyard has built,” Mr Graham said.

The Administrators are now working with the company to prepare an independent report for creditors within the statutory timeframes.

A first meeting of creditors will be held on Friday 4 November 2016. Information regarding this meeting will be made available directly to all creditors.

A second meeting – known as the ‘watershed’ meeting – will be held within twenty-five (25) working days on a date to be advised.

[ENDS]

    Preliminary results announcement for first half of FY17
    9:21am, 28 Feb 2017 | HALFYR
  

  NZX Release

28 February 2017

Preliminary results announcement for first half of FY17 

Veritas Investments Limited (NZX: VIL) announces that its unaudited net profit after tax (NPAT) for the six months to 31 December 2016 increased to $1,205,546, compared to a net loss of $(4,815,958) in the previous corresponding period, an improvement of $6,021,504. 

The Underlying NPAT from continuing operations and before significant items (Underlying NPAT) improved by 29% to $2,513,762 in the reporting period, compared to $1,941,386 in the previous corresponding period. There were no significant losses in the first half of FY17 compared to $(4,223,033) in the first half of FY16. Operating cash flow improved by 128% to $1,833,467, from $804,894 in the previous period. 

Net revenue for the period was $15,912,862 compared to $19,133,865 in the six months to 31 December 2015, a decrease of 17%, due to the closure of a number of underperforming Mad Butcher stores and the sale of three bars in Hamilton. Total losses from discontinued operations were $(1,308,216) in the first half of FY17 compared to $(2,534,311) in the first half of FY16. 

A reconciliation of the VIL Group’s Underlying NPAT to its reported result complying with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) is as attached.

Commentary on Veritas’ individual businesses is detailed below:

Mad Butcher
The market has been competitive with supply shortages creating challenges around product choice and pricing.  The Board’s focus is on ensuring profitability within each store and we are working closely with franchisees to support and maximise their performance. During the first half of FY17, we purchased two stores and sold one store.   

The brand continues to be a major contributor to Veritas’ profitability generating EBITDA  of $2,132,915 in the period compared to $1,916,933 in the previous corresponding period. 

There are currently 32 Mad Butcher stores, 29 of which are franchised and three are company owned. The Board are exploring a range of options for these company owned stores. 

The Better Bar Company 
The Better Bar Company exceeded its targets for the period. Some redevelopment of existing sites was completed, including the creation of additional space in the two high profile Viaduct Harbour outlets in Auckland, Danny Doolans and O’Hagan’s. 

A focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced menu and entertainment options and good cost control has led to improved results, with the bars earning EBITDA of $3,081,255 in the period compared to $2,654,912 in 2015. 

Nosh 
Subsequent to balance date Veritas sold the Nosh business to Gosh Holding Limited on 24 February 2017, with the net proceeds of the sale used to reduce Veritas group’s bank debt to ANZ. Accordingly, the results of the business have been reclassified as a discontinued operation. The half year financial statements do not include any amount for the loss on sale, which is expected to be in the range of $2.2m - $2.6m after tax. 

Kiwi Pacific Foods 
All material matters pertaining to the closure and wind up of the business will be completed by 31 March 2017. 

Updated Outlook and Market Guidance
Our previous market guidance for FY17 on 1 November 2016 was for the Group to achieve Revenue of $50m - $55m, EBITDA of $7.4m - $8.0m and Underlying NPAT of $3.0m - $3.6m for the full FY17.  

Given the reclassification and subsequent sale of Nosh as a discontinued operation, the Board is restating the guidance for the full year to Revenue of $26m - $31m, EBITDA of $7.9m - $8.5m and Underlying NPAT of $3.7m - $4.3m for FY17.  

No interim dividend 
The Board has resolved that no interim dividend will be declared for the period ended 31 December 2016.

    Vital announces two acquisitions &amp; settles Ormiston
    9:36am,  5 Apr 2017 | ASSET
  

  Vital Healthcare Property Trust (Vital) today announced two separate acquisitions in Australia for a combined value of A$27.6m. The weighted average yield is approximately 7.2% and directly supports Vital’s scale and diversification strategy. Vital also announced it had settled the acquisition of Ormiston Hospital in Auckland.

Acquisition of Grafton Aged Care facility with aged care partner, Hall &amp; Prior 

The Grafton Aged Care facility (Grafton) is a residential aged care facility located in South Grafton, NSW, approximately 70km north of Coffs Harbour on the Clarence River. The facility comprises 43 rooms with a mix of single, double and triple rooms, providing a total of 83 beds. Two adjacent residential properties were also acquired for potential future expansion. Total land area of the acquisition is approximately 12,400sqm. 
With a relatively high and growing proportion of elderly in its catchment, both Hall &amp; Prior and Vital envisage future expansion to meet the rising demand for aged care services. Grafton is being acquired on an initial 20 year lease term with Hall &amp; Prior. 

Chief Executive of Vital’s Manager, David Carr said “This transaction builds on our earlier investment into the residential aged care sector with our highly experienced partner.  We have adopted a conservative and prudent approach to opportunities since our initial acquisition in early 2016. However, our long-term outlook for the sector remains favourable with residential aged care a logical inclusion in our scale and diversification strategy”.

Settlement occurred 31 March.

Acquisition of Epworth Eastern Hospital (Epworth) fit-out and a 6 year lease extension to 25 years  

The acquisition simplifies the ownership structure in preparation for further potential development works at the site. The prevailing lease obligations and periodic review mechanisms all remain unchanged.  

Mr Carr said, “This is an excellent outcome for both Epworth and Vital. We both look forward to the Epworth Campus meeting the growing patient demand in the area and a continuation of the exceptional care provided by the Epworth team.  The six-year lease extension to 25 years cements the long-term commitment to the partnership and delivers additional earnings certainty to Vital and investors”.

The transaction settled in March.

Settlement of Ormiston Hospital, Auckland

Further to the announcement of 27 February 2017, Vital is also pleased to announce that the acquisition of Ormiston Hospital in Flat Bush, Auckland has now settled.

  13 April 2017

NZX Announcement: Trustpower releases operating statistics and updates FY17 guidance

Trustpower releases its operating statistics for the year ended 31 March 2017.

• Lower mass market volume per customer reflecting milder temperatures during Winter, lower irrigation demand during summer and a changing customer mix
• 385,000 total utility accounts (up 1,000 for the quarter) including 90,000 customers with more than one service (up 2,000 for the quarter)
• Strong New Zealand generation volumes in Trustpower’s schemes as well as a full year contribution from King Country Energy
• New Zealand wholesale price has remained well below average throughout the year
• Australian volume and price have remained strong throughout the year
Market expectations for Trustpower’s March 2017 Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation, Amortisation and fair value movements in Financial instruments (EBITDAF) range from $215m  to $235m. Given the strong generation production, particularly in Australia, noted in the attached Operating Statistics Trustpower now expects its EBITDAF (excluding the costs of demerger) to be at the top end of this range.

    Vector expands its energy solutions business
    8:30am, 15 Mar 2017 | ASSET
  

  VECTOR EXPANDS ITS ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS

Vector today announced another step in its strategy to deliver efficient, sustainable energy solutions to consumers, with the acquisition of two companies, E-Co Products Group and PowerSmart.   

E-Co Products, better known as HRV, is a total home solutions business that has built a deep and strong connection with New Zealanders, helping to create healthier homes.

PowerSmart is a leading provider of innovative large scale sustainable power solutions in New Zealand and the South Pacific.  

Vector Chief Executive, Simon Mackenzie, says the businesses will continue to operate independently and provide Vector with complementary channels to deliver innovative technological energy solutions directly to consumers. 

“As new and disruptive energy solutions become available, the way energy is produced, consumed, and monitored is changing. We are focused on leading energy innovation and empowering customers by offering them choice and control.

“The acquisition of both E-Co Products Group and PowerSmart will boost our ability to deliver these new solutions, at both a household and commercial scale. These companies share our vision of a new energy future and we believe it’s an excellent fit for all parties,” Mr Mackenzie said.

E-Co Products Group Chief Executive, Bruce Gordon says E-Co Products is very excited to be joining the Vector group. 

“As New Zealand’s leading energy solutions provider, Vector can provide key expertise and innovation in areas that will benefit our business and take it into a new era,” he said.

PowerSmart Chief Executive, Mike Bassett-Smith, says Vector’s scale and network expertise will assist with the company’s growth plans.

“As the economics of solar and batteries continue to improve, we can leverage Vector’s knowledge and experience to undertake ever larger, more complex projects,” he said.  

Both acquisitions are subject to customary conditions and settlement is expected to occur on or around 31 March.  The acquisitions will be funded from Vector’s existing facilities and are expected to be earnings accretive in FY2018.

Financial impacts of recent storm activity 

Tower Limited (NZX/ASX: TWR) said today that the maximum financial impact of the storms associated with ex-Cyclone Debbie will be $3.6 million after tax.

“Tower is committed to helping its customers get back on their feet as soon as possible,” said Richard Harding, Chief Executive Officer. 

Tower has recently gained access to Edgecumbe and we are working with our customers to assess the damage to their property. As such, a full understanding of the impacts are not yet fully known. 

Based on analysis to date, Tower estimates gross claims costs for storms associated with Cyclone Debbie, including Edgecumbe will reach between $10 million and $12 million. 

Tower’s aggregate reinsurance cover will absorb the first $5 million of losses and catastrophe reinsurance cover will pay for claims in excess of $10 million. Therefore the maximum possible impact of ex-Cyclone Debbie is $3.6 million after tax.

New Zealand has experienced a high number of catastrophic events in the 2017 Financial Year. Tower has already announced after tax profit impacts of:
• $7.2 million for the Kaikoura earthquake, plus the cost of reinsurance reinstatement
• $1 million for Port Hills fires
• $2.6 million for Tasman Tempest storm.

Cyclone Cook’s impact was not as significant as expected, with approximately 120 claims received from customers to date. While still very early, we do not expect this to be a significant event loss.

Tower retains approximately $4 million of aggregate reinsurance cover plus full catastrophe cover of over $700 million, plus appropriate back-up cover. The diagram attached provides an illustrative overview of Tower’s reinsurance structure.

Tower will update the market as the situation develops.

    TeamTalk acknowledges Spark earlier announcement today
    2:02pm,  4 Apr 2017 | TAKEOVER
  

  Spark has affirmed its 80 cent offer price for TeamTalk and that the conditions of its offer will not be waived should shareholders approve the proposed Farmside transaction.

Spark NZ has today affirmed:

• Its offer price for 100% of TeamTalk’s ordinary shares remains at 80 cents per share. This price is full and final for this offer;
•It has waived the condition requiring 90% shareholder acceptance, meaning Spark’s offer will become unconditional as to the level of acceptances upon achieving more than 50% shareholder acceptance;
•In the event that TeamTalk shareholders vote to approve the proposal to sell a 70% share of the Farmside subsidiary to Vodafone at the Special Meeting on April 12th, Spark will not waive the conditions of its offer that would be breached, and Sparks offer will lapse.

Kind Regards

Andrew Miller
